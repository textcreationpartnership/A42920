            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Reader.</head>
            <p>BY the late unſeaſonableneſs of the Weather, thou mayeſt gueſs <hi>(Reader)</hi> what little cauſe there is to promiſe this ARBOR any aſſurance of a flouriſhing Condition; the Air being ſtill ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally diſtempered, yea frozen to ſuch an habit of coldneſs to every thing that is ſubſtantially good. To tell thee what unwholeſom fogs ſtill poiſon the Judgements of men, what blaſphemous vapors are yet exhaled out of hell, by the black Magick of a Reprobate Senſe, is not my purpoſe, nor ſhall be thy entertainment.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Arbor</hi> thou mayeſt walk ſecure from thoſe whirlwinds of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which in bryar-paths and enſnaring Pamphlets raviſh the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and oft times hurry the humbleſt minde to the higheſt pinacle of Preſumption. Here blow no guſts of ſhifting Opinions to menace dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the Veſſel; no ill dews of Pride, Formality, or Hypocriſie, to ſtain the Flowers of this <hi>Arbor,</hi> which are all ſo ſelf-intereſtleſs, as that they fade into a dead letter, without the influence of a pruning hand.</p>
            <p>When the late unſeaſonable ſhowres of Blood had nigh delug'd Gods Vineyard, this <hi>Arbor</hi> lay ſheltered in the Ark of his ſpecial protection, even in the boſom of his ſuper-deluging mercies, when the Land ſeemed to labor under <hi>Egypt's</hi> plagues in a Goſpel-ſeaſon; when our Rivers were turned into blood; and Luſts bred of our ſlimy affections came even like Frogs into the Cloſet of the hearts both of Prince and People; when the duſt of our carkaſes were turned into Vermine, and the Luſts of all Nations monopoliz'd by this like Swarms of Flies, multiplied and corrupted the whole Land, when as if there had been a very grievous Murrain of Beaſts, we might reade Famine in the cheeks of the Land, which were but lean, though very ſanguine; and many of our Members touched with the plague of Boyl and Blayns; when God ſhot the Arrows of his Vengeance like Hail-ſtones on man and beaſt, and ſent Armies of Locuſts into our coaſt; when Darkneſs, which might be ſadly felt, ſeiz'd on our excommunicated Souls, and many of our Firſt-born fell by the ſword, even when the furious <hi>Pharaohs</hi> were unequipaged, whileſt the Servants of the Moſt High waded under his Canopy through a ſea of blood; when a general Apoſtacy from the Truth received, back-clap'd the <hi>Demetrian</hi> Craftsman to ſhout, <hi>Great is</hi> Diana <hi>of the Pſudoproteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants;</hi> when theſe and many other fearful violfulls were pouring out on this exceeding ſinfully ſinful Nation, then, even then, in that lowring age, were the ſeeds of theſe Flowers ſown in hope of a better Reſurrection.</p>
            <p>Thou ſeeſt (<hi>Reader</hi>) in what a turbulent and improper ſeaſon this <hi>Arbor</hi> received its firſt plant, yea and from a hand which hath no other warrant to touch the Sacred Oracles, then the general Calling of a Chriſtian,
<pb facs="tcp:97622:5"/>which to a ſacrilegious Monopoliſt may ſeem no little piece of audacious <hi>Uzzaiſm,</hi> more then an aliquantity of irreſponſible Preſumption, by reaſon of ſuch irregularity of Motion in ſo improper a ſphear.</p>
            <p>Theſe Grapes thus unſeaſonably gathered in the Fall of more then the Leaf, in the Autumn of true and ſound Religion, when the Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs withdrew his influence, and ſtood as at a diſtance from our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon; Wonder not if ſome ſeem even rotten-ripe, though I dare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe thee none are juyceleſs; And know, that though here are few, but happily thou haſt had a taſte of in thy Chriſtian perambulation through the Church's Vineyard, yet remember the ſame Vine oft times proves better in one ſoyl then in another, and ſprouts faireſt when her unfolded arms are wideſt ſpread; and if any diſreliſh thy guſt, impute it not to the ſowreneſs or ſharpneſs of the Grape, but to the indiſpoſition of thine own Pallate.</p>
            <p>To ſay theſe Grapes came all from this or that mans Vine, is a greater piece of Sacriledge then I would wiſh any unfrantick Minde to uſurp: And for my ſelf, if I challenge more then the Gathering, and Digeſting them into the method thou ſeeſt, let me be numbred among the Pulpit-Diurnaliſts. Nor was it ever intended, that herein ſhould be more then was ſufficient for intimation to an induſtrious Genius, what in this kinde might for the Church of God be compleated by a more skilful hand.</p>
            <p>In a Medicinal ſenſe this <hi>Arbor</hi> may not improperly be ſtiled <hi>The Souls Phyſick-Garden;</hi> for the Flowers enamelling it, contain moſt Soveraign Vertue for each Spiritual Malady: What thine is, let Conſcience ſpeak; but ſay not thou art well, for <hi>he who ſaith he hath no ſin, deceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:</hi> And indeed, never was Age more guilty of this Self-deceit, then this; wherein men ſay in their Hearts, and proclaim in their Lives, That <hi>there is no God,</hi> whileſt they mean-while become their own Idols, by ſacrificing to the Calf of the Lip and the Viper in the Brain.</p>
            <p>Look we into the ſtate of the Body Politique, and wiſer men then Empericks tell us, Many Epidemical Diſeaſes are too diſcoverable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: But where the Patient deſerves our Prayers, the Preſs hath no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for Invectives; and 'tis no improvident wiſdom to be ſilent, where our judgements are Non-pluſs'd. Sufficient for the Publique is the evil thereof.</p>
            <p>Phyſitians tell us, The Cure is half way home, when the Malady is known; but experienced Symptomes are oft-times very falſe Prophets, otherwiſe he that is carried about with every wind of Doctrine, might without breach of the leaſt Link in Charities Chain, be ſtiled <hi>Errors Weathercock:</hi> 'Twere not amiſs to preſcribe ſuch the Word of Truth, as a Pillow for their Faith to reſt on, till the <hi>Vertigo</hi> or Giddineſs in the Brain be evaporated; alſo to adviſe them what Doctrines they ſwallow, till tryal be made whether the Spirit be of God or no.</p>
            <p>There are ſome within the Pales of Spiritual Bedlam, that are in ſuch a continual Burning Extaſie, as they can ſeldom or never repoſe their Thoughts in any Spiritual Reſt, but are ever and anon babling Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, without ſenſe, or any feeling of the Power thereof; Spiritual Expreſſions without Affection, and Divinity without Senſe: Their Eyes
<pb facs="tcp:97622:5"/>are Blood-ſhot, and the whole Creature is become ſo Self-reſolved, as no bands, either Civil or Religious, Natural or Politick, can reſtrain, not their Liberty, but their Fury. Theſe Symptomes give it to be a Spiritual Frenzy, cauſed at firſt by Spiritual Pride, and now attended on by deſperate Preſumption: If the <hi>Cephalick</hi> Vein of Ignorance were ſpeedily opened, and an infuſion taken of Humility and Knowledge to the weight of their Zeal, probably the Cure would follow. Others have the faculties of their Souls ſo chain'd and manacled to Carnal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, as that they cannot exerciſe them about Holy Duties, but are quite dead to Good Works, and wholly forget the Duties both of their Publick and Private Callings, otherwiſe then relating to a Carnal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; yea, are ſo Spirit-bound, that they cannot hear a Sermon without nodding to the Preacher, that they muſt take a nap or two; nor ſay their Prayers, but between ſleeping and waking; begin them in a Fog, and conclude them in a Dream. In this Spiritual Lethargy, if the ſtill voyce of the Goſpel be but Cradle-Muſick, the Thunder of the Law ſhould be the Graves-Expoſitor.</p>
            <p>It is within the Bill of Mortality to finde ſome, who having loſt the Function of Vital Graces, all checks of Conſcience, all ſenſe of Sin, all motions of the Spirit, lie gaſping for Spiritual Life, while the breath thereof is checked by Cuſtomary ſinning: This is a Spiritual Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy, onely the Spirit of God can reſtore that Soul. But to loſe the uſe of ſome ſpecial Grace for a time, the operations of this or that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Quality, is a moſt common defect incident to the ſoundeſt of Gods Servants; now to ſuffer an eclipſe of his Favor, anon the Motions of his Spirit, then the comfortable ſenſe of Aſſurance; ſometimes to be wavering in the Faith, at other times to be nigh ſwallow'd up in Doubtings, are all the Symptomes of a Spiritual Palſie. He that is thus affected, muſt give himſelf unto Prayer, That God would fix and ſtabliſh his Heart, confirm his Faith, and cauſe the influence of his Love to revive his Hope, ſealing it up unto full Aſſurance.</p>
            <p>To commit the Sins we would not, is the Epidemical Diſeaſe of the moſt Regenerate, and we are all naturaliz'd unto daily failings. This is a Spiritual <hi>Epilepſie,</hi> or the Falling-ſickneſs; hereditary, thence the more difficult to be cured; yet the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt well applied will do it, if as thou falleſt, thou riſe again by ſound Repentance, and ſo keep to the ſtrict Dyet of New Obedience. But if a Soul be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly taken with ſtrange and violent Fits of ſome deſperate Sins, who formerly had been unaccuſtomed thereto, acquieſcing all his time under the ſilence of a calm Conſcience, and now ruſheth into horrid acts of the groſſeſt Enormities: Conclude that Soul in a Spiritual Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the very Heart muſt be let Blood by ſound Repentance, till the Corruption of the Inner-man, the evil Affections, and vicious Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which held a candle to the Devil to level his Temptations, be all diſcordiated.</p>
            <p>Let the dark Underſtanding that diſcerns not Spiritual things, the Myſtery of Salvation, Excellencies of Chriſt, or Beauties of Holineſs, take <hi>Bartimeus</hi> for his Guide, and pray fervently for Spiritual Eye-ſalve,
<pb facs="tcp:97622:6"/>that Chriſt would touch and unſeal his judgement; but if his Eye offend him, or any Luſt as tender to him as the Apple thereof, Exocula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the Remedy preſcribed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.29. And he, who hath an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthume in his Ears, when God talks with him in the language of his Mercies or his Judgements, of his Word, his Spirit, or his Works, wants an <hi>Ephatha.</hi> But ſeldom are his Lungs Ulcerleſs, whoſe Heart is not in Charity; yet let not ſuch unſheath the Razor in his mouth, and poſſibly the Diſeaſe may not be mortal. Or ſay the Soul is impoſthumated by corrupt Affections, through a long continuance of ſlimy diſtillations and unclean thoughts from the heart, to the obſtruction of the Spiritual Breath, whereby the Graces languiſh, and the Vitals thereof decay: Is not this a Spiritual Hectique, a Conſumption in the higheſt degree? Muſt not that Soul be cleanſed from all filthineſs both of the Fleſh and Spirit? and make a conſtant uſe at every Spring to ſin, and fall from Grace, the Diet-drink of Repentance? Adde to this the Reſtorative of Faith (whoſe principal Ingredients are Gods Promiſes and Chriſts Righteouſneſs) then keep to the ſtrict Diet of a Goſpel-Converſation, and by the Mercy of God through the Merit of Chriſt that Soul ſhall recover.</p>
            <p>Pantings of the Heart after a full Meal of Spiritual Dainties, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a full ſtomack after ſome plentiful Feaſt of Heavenly Manna, is no ſtrange Malady in the childe of God. If thoſe pantings proceed from a fulneſs of the Spirit, and not from an emptineſs of Grace; if they are after Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, not after the World and its Vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloriouſneſs, its then a bleſſed Malady, and the Cure is mortal; in this caſe trouble not the Phyſitian. But if thoſe pantings of the Heart be through too much vacuity of Grace, occaſioned by worldly Cares or carnal Grief, whereby follows a loſs of Appetite to that Food which came down from Heaven, thereby rendring the ſtomack unapt for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion of Spirit-ſavoring Meats; In this caſe ſuch things as callifie and corroborate the Heart, are not improper: Let therefore thy Prayer be as Frankincenſe, thy Humility as Camomil, thy Faith as Maſtick, thy Penitence as Wormwood; of each a like quantity, in this Diſtemper, will afford an excellent Plaiſter to apply to the Heart.</p>
            <p>Obedience to the ſixth Commandment, is a ſoveraign Remedy againſt a Spiritual Pluriſie; and if thou ſpit Blood, the Rule <hi>Paul</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the <hi>Romans, Rom.</hi> 12.18. is very proper for thy Conſtitution. Alſo Envy, Pride and Ambition, are very Tympanous Maladies, which in time engender a Spiritual Dropſie; but Charity, Humility and Self-denial, will evacuate thoſe flatuous Humors. Likewiſe Abſtinence is the onely Cure after a Surfet of ſin, to which adde Faſting and Prayer. But if thou art troubled with the Stone, I mean in the Heart, Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber who was <hi>Davids</hi> Key-keeper; who, wert thou all Adamant, can filiarize thee unto <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The immoderate heat of any Luſt, which hath its origination from the Heart, will in time ſpread it ſelf by the Faculties into the whole Soul, and impede the operations of Grace: This is a Spiritual Feaver, whereof there be divers kindes. If this be thy Malady, whether a
<pb facs="tcp:97622:6"/>Burning-Feaver through the violence of ſome ſtrong Temptations, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans fiery Darts, or through the Inflammation of ſome inordinate Luſt; or whether a Putrid-Feaver, through the foul corruptions of Nature and filthineſs of ſin; or whether a Quotidian-Feaver, whereby the whole courſe of thy life is but as one fit of ſin; or whether a Tertian or a Quartan-Feaver, wherein, through the intermiſſion of the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and occaſions of ſin, thou enjoyeſt ſome intervals of a better diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, though no health; or whether a Hectique-Feaver, whereby a ſinful ſlame is kindled, not onely in the meer Natural Qualities and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior Inclinations of the Minde, but alſo in the more Noble Faculties and higher Region of the Soul, which through the habitualneſs of that equal Heat in all the Faculties alike, renders thee inſenſible of thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, and thence nigh incurable: Be it either or all of theſe, do but ſavingly Believe in the Phyſitian, and thy Faith ſhall make thee whole; but then be ſure to perſevere in the Faith, and beware of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſes.</p>
            <p>Some ſay the Times are very Leprous, and that the people are peſtered with very venomous Botches; That the Gangrene of Envy hath almoſt unbowell'd them, and the Scurf of Hypocriſie ſtrangely deformed them; That the Ulcer of Injuſtice hath caſt a perpetual <hi>Odium</hi> on them, and the <hi>Appetitus Caninus</hi> of Covetouſneſs hath made but one Morſel of them; That the Wolf of Sacriledge hath devour'd the Breaſts which gave Chriſtendom ſuck in her old Age; That though the Land hath had a Bloody Iſſue of nigh Twelve years running, yet never could have ſo much as a touch at the Hem of Chriſts Garment; That the belching of Blaſphemy in a Convulſion of Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhip, is as common as the diſgorging of Oathes to unſurfet the high ſtomacks of the proud and prophane. If theſe or the like be the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical Maladies of theſe latter days, wherein the Devil is put to his Wits end, then let me preſcribe this <hi>Holy Arbor</hi> as a ſtanding <hi>Pharma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copeia,</hi> not for the ſhelf of every cloſet, but for the cloſet of every heart; wherein there is not a Drug that hath the leaſt allay of any Poyſon in it, nor a dangerous or obſtruſe Ingredient: for the cautious Artiſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how untowardly ruder hands have gone to Compoſition with Divine Truths, what ſpurious Extractions have been thence drawn, and what Miſchief hath thence followed; knowing alſo what rural judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and tender Spirits may meet herewith, his care was greateſt how he might be plaineſt.</p>
            <p>The firſt and rareſt Flower, as Portal to this <hi>Holy Arbor,</hi> that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents it ſelf to thine eye, is, The Sacred Myſtery of the Holy Trinity; indeed a Myſtery viſible onely to the eye of Faith. The unhappy <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> glance at the ſight of a Deity, but to this day diſcern not Three Perſons in one Godhead. The <hi>Gnoſticks</hi> and <hi>Valentinians</hi> have their falſe Multiplying Glaſſes to ſee more Gods then One, but want the Proſpective of Faith to deſcry a Trinity of Perſons in one and the ſame Eternal Eſſence. Such a <hi>Deceptio viſus</hi> hath ſo falſly preſented the <hi>Eunomians</hi> with Three Gods or Spirits, not diſtinguiſhed onely, but divided alſo, as that they could never ſee Three Perſons in one onely
<pb facs="tcp:97622:7"/>Godhead. The <hi>Apollinarians</hi> ſuperacted their ridiculous Faith, and groſly held a Quaternity, not a Trinity of Perſons, was to be Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped. The purblinde <hi>Noetians</hi> and <hi>Hermogenians</hi> had ſight enough to acknowledge the naked Name of Three in the Godhead, yet denied the Perſons. The <hi>Patripaſsians,</hi> that blaſphemouſly held the Father became Fleſh and ſuffered, never ſaw into this Myſtery. The ſacrile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <hi>Arrian Hereticks</hi> (who make <hi>Iſrael</hi> to ſin) grant indeed the Names and Perſons of <hi>Three,</hi> yet deny the <hi>Son</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> their Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, yea the whole Trinity their Properties. The prophane <hi>Trinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> acknowledge Three Perſons with their Lips, yet deny their Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity by the Infidelity of their Lives: Thus rendring themſelves guilty of more knowledge then they practice, and conſequently not of fewer ſtripes then are menaced. All theſe are excluded this <hi>Arbor,</hi> and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance open onely for ſuch as by the Heaven-piercing eye of Faith can ſee into the Myſtery of this glorious Truth, and ſtedfaſtly Believe, That <hi>there are Three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe Three are One,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.7.</p>
            <p>The next Flower in order, is the Word of God, Truths Standard, the ſacred Oracles of the Holy Scripture; which while the Prophets, Evangeliſts and Apoſtles penn'd, the Spirit held their hands. If there be any Wretch ſo much an Infidel, under the notion of a Chriſtian, poſſeſſed with the ſpirit of Contradiction to this <hi>Baſis</hi> of all Truths, I conjure him by the Author of that parallelleſs Work, That he haunt not this <hi>Holy Arbor,</hi> whileſt I leave this <hi>Memento</hi> with all ſelfleſs Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, <hi>Thou ſhalt put nothing to the word that I command thee, neither ſhall ye take ought there from,</hi> Deut. 4.2.</p>
            <p>The next concerns the Law and Goſpel; I dare not diſcouple what God hath joyn'd together. The Law, that Touchſtone of all our works, without which we, had not known ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. Far be it therefore from all right by aſſed Chriſtians, to rebel in their hearts with the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines of any out-Lawed Generation, That the Law is now totally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, as if the Law were the tranſgreſſion of the Goſpel: for, though <hi>the Law</hi> of it ſelf <hi>made nothing perfect,</hi> Heb. 7.9. yet is <hi>the Law</hi> in it ſelf a <hi>perfect</hi> and undefiled Law, <hi>converting the ſoul,</hi> Pſal. 19.7. whence the Royal Prophet in other places ſets it down as a ſpecial character of a righteous man, That <hi>the Law of his God is in his heart,</hi> Pſal. 37.31. or that his heart is Gods Law-keeper, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8. yea, <hi>Bleſſed</hi> are they ſtiled, who ſincerely walk in the Law of the Lord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.1. and <hi>ver.</hi> 165. he proclaims Peace to them that love this Law: you may gueſs then at the cauſe of War. No marvel that notwithſtanding our many Faſtings and Prayers God ſtill threatens us with War, <hi>For he that turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away his ear from hearing the Law, even his prayer ſhall be abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Prov. 28.9. And though <hi>now the Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> which is by Faith, <hi>is manifeſted without the Law,</hi> Rom. 3.21. yet <hi>God forbid that we ſhould thence make void the Law through Faith,</hi> whereby <hi>we eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh it,</hi> Rom. 3.31. We acknowledge, That <hi>by the deeds of the Law no fleſh ſhall be juſtified in the ſight of God,</hi> Rom. 3.20. nevertheleſs we muſt acknowledge, That <hi>the Law is holy,</hi> Rom. 7.12. and <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> v. 14.
<pb facs="tcp:97622:7"/>And though Chriſt be ineffectual to them who expect Juſtification by the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.4. himſelf being the <hi>end of the Law;</hi> that is, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſher thereof, <hi>for Righteouſneſs to every one that believeth,</hi> Rom. 10.4. And though as many as be <hi>led by the Spirit, are not under the Law,</hi> that is, not under the Bondage or Curſe of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.18. And though now, <hi>Faith</hi> being <hi>come, we are no longer,</hi> like untuter'd Learners, <hi>under a Schoolmaſter,</hi> that is, the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.25. All this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, yet <hi>know ye not that the Law hath dominion over a man</hi> for term of life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.1. Know ye not that Chriſt came— What to do? <hi>to deſtroy the Law?</hi> no, but <hi>to fulfil it,</hi> Matth. 5.17. and in the 18 Verſe moſt pathetically aſſeverates us an Aſſurance, That <hi>one tittle ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the Law till all be fulfilled:</hi> Wherefore let Heaven and Earth know, That <hi>it is eaſier for them</hi> both <hi>to paſs, then one tittle of the Law to fail,</hi> Luke 16.17.</p>
            <p>With the Law not improperly is joyn'd the Goſpel, that Olive Dove of Mans Salvation; wherein Chriſt proclaims himſelf an Ark for all the Goſpel-<hi>Noachims,</hi> againſt the Deluge of his Fathers Wrath. The light of this Goſpel ſhines both on the juſt and unjuſt; but the beams thereof have happy influence onely on the Heirs of Grace, melting the hearts of ſuch into Faith and Repentance, whileſt they harden the cley-hearts of carnal Worldlings into ſtupidity and ſearedneſs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, whoſe Mindes the god of this World hath blinded, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. yet the expreſs Command for Diſpenſation thereof, is as Catholick as Chriſt or words could make it; when being Riſen from the Dead, he accoſted his Diſciples, ſaying, <hi>Go ye into all the world, and preach the Goſpel to every creature,</hi> Mark 16.15. So that <hi>if the Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.3.</p>
            <p>In the next place ſtands the Miniſterial Function, the higheſt imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ever the Lord of Heaven vouchſafed the Sons of men. If the Miniſters of the Word would ſit down ſatisfied with the Stiles and Titles given them in Scripture, they needed no other Herald to blazon the Nobleneſs of their Calling, nor any Stellicidiaries to invite the <hi>Hoſanna</hi>'s of the People. Are they not called The Salt of the Earth? the Builders of Chriſts Body? Gods Fellow-workmen? Chriſts Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors? the Stewards of the Houſe? the Fathers of the Church? Fiſhers of men? Miniſters of the Spirit? Builders of the Temple? Shepherds of the Sheep? Planters and Waterers of the Garden? the Lords Harveſt men? his Vine-dreſſers? Watchmen of the City? Trumpeters of the Hoſt? yea Stars of the Firmament, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. It were worth a National Faſt, that all ſuch as are thus highly dignified, were or might be reſponſibly qualified: Attribute we therefore none of theſe Titles to any ſuch as are unfaithful in their Embaſſie, not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavory Salt, not to the Ignorant or Idle, not to the Scandalous nor the Mercenary, not to the Contentious nor the Covetous, not to the Proud nor to the Superſtitious, into whoſe Mindes the ſubtile Sophiſter of all Ages hath ſpecially in this foiſted ſuch ſpecious Qualifications, and ſuch ſelf-deceiving Equivocations to palliate thoſe ſins, as if in order to Life and Doctrine, he would feign perſwade the World, to
<pb facs="tcp:97622:8"/>ſpight the POPE, the CLERGY could not erre.</p>
            <p>Next follows the <hi>Hearing of the Word;</hi> by this cometh Faith, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this poſteth Atheiſm; yet <hi>take heed what ye hear,</hi> Mark 2.24. yea and <hi>how ye hear,</hi> Luke 8.18. Away therefore with itching ears, with prejudicate thoughts, with an impreparatory heart, with preſumptuous ſelf-conceits: Away with diſtracted Cogitations, unſanctified Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, turbulent Paſſions, ſublunar Cares, careleſs and extravagant At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: Away with carnal Security, with vain Diſſention of Opinions touching the Truths delivered: Away with overchargings of Nature, with drowſie Faculties, with Unbelief, Hardneſs of Heart, Pride and uncharitable Thoughts, ever Remembring that it is (or ſhould be) the Word of God and not of man, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13. not a tittle whereof ſhall go unfulfilled, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.18. till it become the ſavor of life unto life, or of death unto deeper condemnation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Take heed therefore how ye hear,</hi> Luke <hi>ibid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After the Word, in order follows the Sacraments, which though they confer no Grace <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> yet are effectual Signs and Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of Gods incomprehenſible Benevolence to man-wards: For of Baptiſm ſaith our Savior, <hi>He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Mark 16.16. And of his Supper, he ſaith, <hi>This is my Body which is given,</hi> Luke 22.19. <hi>and broken for you,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.24. <hi>This is my Blood of the New Teſtament, that is ſhed for many for the remiſsion of ſins,</hi> Luke 22.20. Indeed a Sacrament is a Covenant of Gods free Favor to us, confirmed by ſome outward Sign or Seal inſtituted by himſelf. Thus was the Tree of Life a Sacrament to <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 2.9. The Rainbow to <hi>Noah, Gen.</hi> 9.9, 13. The ſmoaking Furnace to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 15.17, 18. The Fleece of Wooll to <hi>Gideon, Judg.</hi> 6.37. The Dyal to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.7, 11. The Sacrifices, Circumciſion, and the Paſchal Lamb, to the Jews; Baptiſm and the Lords Supper to the Faithful under the Goſpel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19.</p>
            <p>In the next place ſtands Prayer, the Souls Incenſe, whereby ſhe is wing'd for Heaven. Wonderful are the Works wrought by Prayer, not as a Cauſe, but onely as an Inſtrument ſanctified by God, and effectual to the Righteous, if it be fervent, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. This Fervency is that Magnetick Vertue in Prayer which attracts Heaven to Earth; but the fervent Prayer of an unrighteous man availeth little, ſave to betray his ſiniſter dexterity in vanifying ſo excellent a Gift, which in ſuch, the Lord knows, too often comes within a breaths bredth of Blaſphemy. But let the Faithful be exceeding cautious whom they cenſure in this caſe, leſt they chance to touch the Apple of Gods eye; and let him that prayeth pray fervently, for Faith is full of vigor, full of life, and God loveth a ſprightly Faith; yea, the Promiſe made to the Prayer of a Righteous man, is not otherwiſe annex'd then on the condition of Fervency: which we may not dream is confin'd to the activity of external geſtures, or vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubility of a never-ſtammering tongue, but chiefly conſiſts in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of the Supplicant, in the extent of his Faith, and cordiality of his Deſires.</p>
            <p>Next follows the Lords Prayer, if we have not forgot that there is
<pb facs="tcp:97622:8"/>ſuch a thing in <hi>rerum natura Spiritualium.</hi> It's worth a Catechiſm to ask the Worlds Favorites, Which of them, that do ſo highly adore this Prayer, can truly ſay <hi>Our Father:</hi> Moſt can ſay, but few can pray it: Others diſuſe it under the notion of a ſet Form of Prayer; but ſet Forms of Prayer <hi>quatenus</hi> ſuch are not prohibited. This is indeed a ſet Form of words for Prayer, but no ſet Prayer, as is generally miſ-thought; for it is a Prayer to none but ſuch as can pray it in Faith. Nor can there pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be ſaid to be any ſuch thing as a ſet Prayer, for (in ſubmiſſion to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter judgements) I conceive the motion of the Spirit in Prayer, is that which denominates Prayer to be Prayer; which Spirit is not confineable by this or any ſet Form of words, as may appear, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.15. For the motion of the Spirit in one praying the ſame words of another, may be more extenſively Spiritual in that one then in the other; which could not be, if the very words ſet in that Form, Method and Order, could confine the Spirit: And hence it is that all that can ſay the Lords Prayer, cannot pray <hi>Our Father;</hi> for my voyce may be articulate enough without Faith, but without Faith and the Spirit that articulate ſound cannot properly be called a Prayer, though articulated by the form of words in the Lords Prayer. Thus though many ſay the ſame form of words for Prayer, yet they may not be ſaid to pray the ſame Prayer; yea one and the ſame perſon at ſundry times praying the ſame form of words, may not infallibly be ſaid to pray the ſame Prayer, for it varies according to the meaſure of the Spirit in the perſon praying, which may not be one &amp; the ſame in the ſame perſon at all times, though the form of words be ſtill the ſame: for as there are divers operations of the ſame Spirit in divers perſons, yet not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite each to other; ſo there may be divers motions of the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit at divers times in one and the ſame perſon, yet not contrary each to other: for who can ſay he hath the ſame meaſure of the Spirit at all times alike? Now then, if any one can compoſe a ſet Form of the Spirit, which no Creature dare uſurp; or confine the Spirit to a ſet form of words, which Angels want Rhetorick to do, then poſſibly may he make a ſet Form of Prayer. Call it then not a ſet Form of Prayer, but a ſet Form for Prayer. To think the Spirit can be ſtinted by words ſet in this or that Form, is a popular Miſtake, becauſe the Spirit hath an extent beyond both the Reſtraint of the ſtricteſt words, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limeſt ſignification of any words; and becauſe the Spirit of Faith, which is the <hi>Cauſa ſine qua non</hi> of Prayer, is not limitable by words; indeed the gift of Elocution, the gift of Utterance, the ſubject-matter to be prayed for, and the like, may be ſtinted by words; but the grace of Faith, the grace of Love, the grace of Zealous Fervency, ſuch ſpecial operations of the Spirit in Prayer cannot be ſtinted by words, nor can ſet words limit them; becauſe when they are wound up to the heighth, they have ſtill an implicite voyce in the heart, beyond whatever can be uttered by the tongue: And this is known in Scripture by the pouring out of the heart before God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.8. Inſomuch that when a ſoul in Faith prays, as we ſay, <hi>ex tempore,</hi> even then the words of the tongue, though unlimited, yet comes oft times far ſhort of the language of the heart, which is the Spirits proper Dialect, and which
<pb facs="tcp:97622:9"/>could not be, if words might reſtrain the Spirit. Indeed if the Spirit were onely in the words, or wholly confin'd to the words, then muſt it be ſtinted by the words. Thus a ſet Form for Prayer is a ſtinting of the ſubject-matter to be prayed for, and that by the ſtinting of the words; but is not a ſtinting of the Spirit, which is too Spiritual to be limited by words. If I can pray in the liberty of the Spirit without any words at all, no queſtion but I may pray in the liberty of the Spirit with any words aptly compoſed for Prayer, ſo long as the Spirit is not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptible by words; for though the words of a Petition confine me to pray, <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> as the ſubject matter to be prayed for in that Petition, yet my Spirit is left at liberty to pray that Petition in Faith, Zeal and Fervency, proportionable to the meaſure of the Spirit vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed me, and not to the method and the number of the words pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed me: For the operation of the Spirit in Prayer, refers to that Love which the Author of the Spirit bears to the party praying, and not to any form of words compoſed for Prayer. Beſides, a Prayer prayed <hi>ex tempore,</hi> without any premeditated or preceding compoſure of words into a certain Form, is not onely to the joynt-Supplicant Auditors, but alſo to the party himſelf praying <hi>viva voce</hi> a ſet Form for Prayer: for he cannot pray at all <hi>viva voce</hi> without a Form ſet, either premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively ſet, or ſet <hi>ex tempore,</hi> the latter whereof is as well a ſet Form in all audible Prayers as the other, and that not onely to the co-Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, but alſo to the party himſelf audibly praying, becauſe words muſt neceſſarily fall within thoſe bounds the Compoſer frames them, and no other; whereby at laſt they become a Form ſet, whether premeditatively framed, or framed <hi>ex tempore,</hi> and that as well to him that frameth and prayeth them audibly, as to them who joyn therein with him; ſo that if the Spirit be ſtinted by the one, it is ſtinted by the other alſo: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently we could not audibly pray at all without ſtinting the Spirit, were that common Aſſertion true, That the Spirit is ſtinted by a ſet form of words. Indeed if there could be a ſet Form of the Spirit, and conſequently a ſet Prayer indeed, then it might be granted that thus the Spirit might be ſtinted. And thus we grant, That there may be a ſet form of words for Prayer, but no ſuch thing as a ſet Prayer, for that is onely of the Spirits compoſure, which is no way ſubject to words. And ſo this may ſtand for a Concluſion, That no words whatſoever, be they never ſo defectively or comprehenſively compoſed into any Form for Prayer, can be properly ſaid to lay a reſtraint on the Spirit, which with no words or any words hath ſtill its liberty in the fervent Prayer of Faith. Yet to prevent Miſunderſtandings, we may not think but a ſet Form of words for Prayer doth ſtint and limit the Petitions, though not the Spirit wherein and wherewith they are petitioned. Nor is this ſo ſaid in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſet Forms for Prayer, as to leſſen at all the excellency of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporal Prayer, for the Spirit hath its liberty in both. And as I hold ſet Forms of petitions for Prayer may be of moſt excellent uſe to ſuch as have Faith and a meaſure of the Spirit, yet want the gift of Elocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo I likewiſe hold, That they are but of ſubordinate uſe to them whoſe infirmities are helped and ſupplied by the Spirit without them;
<pb facs="tcp:97622:9"/>and that all Prayers whatever ought to carry in them, touching the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and maner of them, a Reſemblance parallel to that Form for Prayer which Chriſt ſet and taught his Diſciples, and in them us. From which therefore let no man for faſhions ſake think himſelf exempted, becauſe it is a ſet Form; for is not the extemporal Prayer of another man in my audience a ſet Form to me, yea and to himſelf alſo, being extemporally, though not premeditately ſet? Or are we exempted from it becauſe ſome Idolize it? Is the ſin of Commiſſion in one, a warrant for the ſin of Omiſſion in another? Or are we indeed exempted from it under a pretence of the Spirits being ſtinted by it? Is not all that is ſupplicable or can be prayed for, therein comprehended, if the Rejecters thereof underſtood it? Or doth the excellency of that Prayer too much eclipſe the luſtre of our own, both being prayed in Faith? Are we ſo Prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proud? Doth it not rather ſupply the defects of our own? Or is the bare verbalizing of that Prayer in the faithleſs and ignorant, a ground ſufficient for the godly to deny it their Zeal, their Faith, their Hearts? Are we exempted from it under a ſuppoſition that it is too Good for ſinners? Is not this rather an Idolizing of the words? Have we no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to it, becauſe Chriſt taught it onely to his Diſciples? Abſiſt. Muſt not the Faithful pray it, becauſe the Wicked babble it? Shall I reject Scripture becauſe the Devil hath uſed it? Muſt we never pray it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may not always be abſolutely neceſſary? may it therefore be never expedient? Hence then never let any ſober Chriſtian more undervalue this Form for Prayer, for the reaſon onely of others thinking too highly of it; nor admire it for the reaſon of others vain undervaluing it; but pray it in Knowledge, Faith and Fervency, without which the words are as a dead letter. This Form is compleatly Comprehenſive of all things pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titionable, whether Spiritual, Temporal or Eternal; an exact Epitomy of what God hath promiſed to give, or man hath leave to ask. It is that Form of words for Prayer which our Savior taught his Diſciples, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them, when they pray, to ſay, <hi>Our Father which</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Next follows that <hi>Creed,</hi> which vulgarly is ſtiled <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we make Confeſſion of that Faith which believes in one God, even the true God, one in Eſſence, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.4. Three in Perſons, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.7. The Father the Creator, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 134.3. the Son the Redeemer, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. the Holy Ghoſt the Sanctifier, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. which Believes that the Holy, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3, 4. and Catholick Church, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.2. conſiſts of the Faithful people of God; which Believes that there is a Communion of Saints, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.15, 16. Pardoned of all ſins, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.22. Appointed to Riſe from Death, and to enjoy Eternal Life both in Body and Soul, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.39, 40.</p>
            <p>In the next, a word of the Decalogue in general; How in the Table of mans Heart it ſtood engraven before it was repeated in ſtone; Alſo how and in what maner the Law was given; How many ways the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue's divided; with Rules concerning the ſubſtance and meaning thereof in general. Various and voluminous are the Expoſitions on the Commandments; but here as in a Map, <hi>quaſi uno intuita,</hi> thou mayeſt deſcry the whole Region of the Law of God: The ſame may be ſaid of
<pb facs="tcp:97622:10"/>the whole Work, as it ſtands in relation to the ſubject it treats of. Now becauſe we are not under the Law but under Grace, ſome have dream'd, That the Enacting of the Goſpel hath Repealed the Statutes made when <hi>Moſes</hi> was Speaker; the Lord awaken them. <hi>Do we now make void the Law through Faith? God forbid; yea, we eſtabliſh the Law,</hi> Rom. 3.31. <hi>David,</hi> a man in requeſt with God, a man after his own heart, took the Teſtimonies of God for his Heritage for ever, made them the joy of his heart, and reſolved to keep the Commandments of his God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.112, 115. and in <hi>ver.</hi> 126. he ſaith, <hi>It is time for thee, O Lord, to work, for they have made void thy Law;</hi> and in the next Verſe moſt paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declares his affection, ſaying, <hi>I love thy Commandments above gold, yea above fine gold.</hi> A plain Diſcovery why others reject them. But, <hi>if thou wilt live, keep the Commandments,</hi> Prov. 7.2. keep them exactly, univerſally, conſtantly, chearfully and ſincerely. Have no Gods but One, and that the onely true God. Worſhip no Created thing. In vain do not take Gods Name in thy thoughts, actions or otherwiſe. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate the Seventh day. Reverence thy Superiors, but not with Religious Worſhip. Commit no Adultery by the eye or otherwiſe. Do not play the Thief in thy Calling or otherwiſe. Give no falſe Teſtimony; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor after that excellent gift of Contentation. Thus, with holy <hi>David,</hi> have thou reſpect to all the Lords Commandments, and that continually, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.117. for, <hi>the Lord ſheweth Mercy unto Thouſands of them that love him, and keep his Commandments,</hi> Exod. 20.6.</p>
            <p>The next is touching the Infinite Love of God to Man, The Decree of Election, according to the good will and pleaſure of God from all Eternity; The Creation of all things out of nothing, without any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, Means, Aſſiſtance or Motion, onely by the Word of God alone; The Redemption of Man by the Imputation of the ſufferings of the puniſhment due for ſin in the perſon of our Mediator; <hi>Vocation,</hi> whereby we are called from Darkneſs to Light, from a ſtate of Nature to a ſtate of Grace, from out of the World to the Kingdom of Heaven, from being Limbs of Satan to be Members of Chriſt, from Children of Wrath to become the Heirs of Heaven; <hi>Juſtification,</hi> whereby God abſolveth true Believers from the guilt of ſin, by the Imputation of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt; <hi>Sanctiſication,</hi> or the inward changing of a juſtified man, purged from all the corruption of Nature, and endued with inward Righteouſneſs, whereby the Image of God is reſtored in him; <hi>Adoption,</hi> whereby the juſtified, through the Union they have with Chriſt, are accounted of God as his own Children; <hi>Regeneration,</hi> or the repairing of the decayed eſtates of our ſouls, the Holy Ghoſt actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating the hearts of Gods Elect to a free, conſtant and faithful exerciſe of a holy life; <hi>Converſion,</hi> or mutation of a corrupt Minde, Life and Will, into a good, ſtirred up in the Choſen by the Holy Ghoſt, through the Preaching of the Goſpel; <hi>Repentance,</hi> that inward and continual ſorrowing and mourning for the Commiſſion of ſin, joyned with Faith, Humiliation, and a conſtant turning from all ſin unto God, with a hatred and loathing thereof, thus accompanied with both inward and outward amendment; and <hi>New Obedience,</hi> whereby a man is renewed unto
<pb facs="tcp:97622:10"/>that whereunto he was enabled by Creation; whereby being endued with Faith and Repentance, he doth, according to the meaſure of Grace received, endeavor to yield Obedience to all Gods Commandments with the whole man: for which end even the Revelation of the Myſtery which was kept ſecret ſince the World began, was made known to all Nations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.26.</p>
            <p>The next ſpeaks of <hi>Faſting,</hi> that holy and extraordinary Abſtinence from the commodities of this life, for our better humiliation and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration to Prayer, when any Judgement on our ſelves or Brethren is either threatned, feared, begun or executed. How this part of Divine Worſhip hath been of late years prophaned in this Land, may to this day be read in the <hi>Euroclydons</hi> of Gods fearful Judgements; Inſomuch as its now neceſſary that we Faſt for our Faſts: For did we not Faſt to Wrath, to Revenge, to Strife, to Envy, to Debate? Did we not Feaſt our Luſts, when nought but the poſture of a Bulruſh could denote our Faſting? Did we not Faſt at Noon to ſurfet at Night? Did we not even then afflict our Brethren in ſtead of our Souls? Did we not finde pleaſure in the day of our Faſts, and exact all our Labors? Did we not draw Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity with cords of Vanity, even then when we ſhould have looſed the Bands of Wickedneſs? Did we not even then load on weights grievous to be born, in ſtead of undoing the heavy Burthens? Did we not even then alſo receive the gain of Oppreſſion, in ſtead of letting the oppreſſed go free? Did we not then likewiſe take the ſtaff of Life from ſuch as were half famiſhed before, in ſtead of dealing our bread to the hungry? Did we not then alſo caſt the poor out of their own Dwellings, in ſtead of bringing them that were caſt out into our own? Did we not even ſtrip the very dead of their ſhrowds, in ſtead of covering the naked? In a word, Did we not at our Faſts invite the Devil to a Feaſt? <hi>Is it ſuch a Faſt that I have choſen?</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.5. <hi>Did ye at all Faſt unto me, even to me?</hi> Zech. 7.5. <hi>This is a lamentation, and muſt be for a lamentation.</hi> Wherefore Faſt of thy Faſts, O Nation, Repent of thy Repentance, leſt the Lord forbid his Prophets to pray for thee, Reject thy Cry when thou Faſt, and conſume thee by the Sword, the Famine, and the Peſtilence, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.11, 12.</p>
            <p>Next follows a word of <hi>Holy Feaſting,</hi> ſeaſonable onely at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Benefits or removal of Evils; wherein we are to have a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial eye and regard to thoſe Four Graces; <hi>viz. Thankſgiving, Fear, Temperance</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> without which it may be feared leſt the Lord deal with us as he threatned <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and turn our Feaſts into mourning, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.10. yea, ſpread the dung, even the dung of our Feaſts, on our Faces, <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.3. For when we Feaſt, do we not eat to our ſelves, and drink to our ſelves? Are there not ſpots in our Love-Feaſts? Do we not Feaſt with the Leaven of Malice and Wickedneſs? Is it with the unleavened Bread of Sincerity and Truth? Wherefore, though at ſuch times a more free and liberal uſe of the Creature is not unſeaſonable, yet ever remember, that <hi>it is better to go to the houſe of Mourning, then to the houſe of Feaſting:</hi> But if thou wilt make a Feaſt, obey our Saviors com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and call the poor, the lame, the maimed, and the blinde, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.13.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:97622:11"/>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline,</hi> that keeps the Key of Life and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, offers it ſelf to our conſideration: Without which every man is at liberty to write, act and ſpeak according to the pleaſure of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and blaſphemous Heart; without which we may expect the fall of the Walls of the holy Vineyard, and a breach open for the Wilde Bore of the Eaſt, and the little Foxes of the Weſt to devour the Grapes; without which the Magiſtrate wears a Sword without point or edge; without which Vice lords it, and Vertue's enſlaved; without which the Children ſtarve, whileſt holy things are given to Dogs; without which the deſperate Wills of prophaneſt men eſtabliſh Iniquity as a Law to be obeyed on pain of Martyrdom. Submit thy ſelf therefore to this and every Ordinance of God, who hath ſealed a Commiſſion to his Church with an <hi>Amen</hi> to it, That <hi>whatſoever they ſhall binde on Earth ſhall be bound in Heaven, and whatſoever they ſhall looſe on Earth ſhall be looſed in Heaven,</hi> Matth. 18.18.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>(Reader)</hi> having ſhewed thee the way to this <hi>Holy Arbor,</hi> the Door is open; onely let me whiſper this word in thy Heart at parting, That thou <hi>take heed how thou Readeſt,</hi> not knowing but the Trump may Sound ere thou arrive at the other end of this <hi>Arbor.</hi> The Lord grant This may not then Riſe in Judgement againſt either of our <hi>Errata's.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>ONe of the deepeſt Myſteries of our Religion, is, That God is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt; and again, That the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt are one and the ſame God: So it is one of the moſt myſterious points of our Faith, To believe in one God, who is diſtinct in three Subſiſtances or Perſons, called, The Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, who are three in perſon; and again, they three are one, not in perſon, but in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. By Nature is meant, a thing ſubſiſting by it ſelf, that is common to many: By Perſon is meant, a thing or eſſence ſubſiſting by it ſelf, not common to many, but incommunicable. In this Myſtery of the Trinity, the Divine Nature is the Godhead it ſelf, ſimply and abſolutely conſidered; and a Perſon is that which ſubſiſteth in this Godhead, as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt. If any man would conceive in minde rightly the Divine Nature, he muſt conceive God or the Godhead abſolutely; if any of the Perſons, then he muſt conceive the ſame Godhead rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, with Perſonal properties. Thus the Godhead conſidered, with the propriety of Fatherhood or Begetting, is the Father; and conceiving the ſame Godhead, with the propriety of Generation paſſively taken, we conceive the Son; and the ſame Godhead, with the propriety of Proceeding, we conceive the Holy Ghoſt. Neither may it ſeem ſtrange to any, that the names of Nature and Perſon are uſed to ſet forth this Myſtery by, for they have been taken up by common conſent in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church, and are contained in the Scriptures, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.8.</p>
                  <p>This Myſtery may well be conceived by a Compariſon borrowed from Light: The light of the Sun, the light of the Moon, and the light of the Air, for nature and ſubſtance are all one and the ſame light; and yet they are three diſtinct lights: The light of the Sun being of it ſelf, and from none; the light of the Moon from the Sun; and the light of the Air from them both: So the Divine Nature is one, and the Perſons are three, ſubſiſting after a diverſe maner in one and the ſame Nature. The three Perſons are one, not ſimply, but one in Nature; that is, Coeſſential, or Conſubſtantial, having all one Godhead, becauſe there is one God and no more in Nature; conſidering that the thing which is Infinite, is but one, and is not ſubject to multiplication. And as theſe three Perſons are one in Nature, ſo whatſoever agrees to God, ſimply conſidered, agrees to them all three: They are all Coequal and Coeternal; All moſt Wiſe, Juſt, Merciful, Omnipotent, by one and the ſame Wiſdom, Juſtice, Mercy, Power. And becauſe they have all one Godhead, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not onely one with another, but alſo each in other, the Father in the Son, the Son in the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt in them both: And we muſt not imagine that theſe three are one God in this ſenſe, as though the Father had one part of the Godhead, the Son another part, and the Holy Ghoſt a third; for that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97622:12"/>is moſt falſe, becauſe the Infinite and moſt ſimple Godhead, is not ſubject to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or Diviſion, but admits a Diſtinction without any Separation. And whereas it is ſaid, That the Son and the Holy Ghoſt have their beginning from the Father, we muſt know, that it is not a beginning of their Nature, or of their God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head from the Father, but of their Perſon onely: for the Godhead of all three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons is uncreate, and unbegotten, and proceeding from none. So alſo whereas it is ſaid, That the Son and the Holy Ghoſt have received all their Attributes, as Wiſdom, Knowledge, Power, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the Father, we muſt know, That that which the Son receiveth of the Father, he receiveth it by Nature, and not by Grace; and he receiveth not a part, but all that the Father hath, ſaving the perſonal propriety: So the Holy Ghoſt receiveth from the Father and the Son by Nature, and not by Grace.</p>
                  <p>Now the diſtinction of the Perſons is notably ſet forth unto us in the Baptiſm of our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.16, 17. where it is ſaid, that <hi>when Jeſus was baptized, he came out of the water;</hi> there is the ſecond Perſon: <hi>And the holy Ghoſt deſcended upon him in the form of a Dove;</hi> there is the third Perſon: and the Father, the firſt Perſon, pronounced from Heaven, that <hi>he was his onely beloved Son, in whom he was well pleaſed.</hi> Again, the Trinity is proved 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7. This is the Myſtery of all Myſteries to be received of us all, namely, The Trinity of the Perſons in the Unity of the Godhead. The Perſons are they, which ſubſiſting in one Godhead, are diſtinguiſhed by incommunicable properties, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7. <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.24. <hi>John</hi> 1.1. They are Coequal, and diſtinguiſhed not by degree, but by order: Divided they cannot be, by reaſon of the infinite greatneſs of that moſt ſimple Eſſence, which one and the ſame is wholly in the Father, wholly in the Son, and wholly in the Holy Ghoſt; ſo that in theſe there is diverſity of Perſons, but Unity of Eſſence: The Communion of the Perſons, or rather Union, is that by which each one is in the reſt, and with the reſt, by reaſon of the Unity of the Godhead; and therefore every each one doth poſſeſs, love and glorifie another, and work the ſame thing, <hi>John</hi> 14.10. <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.22, 30. <hi>John</hi> 1.1. and 5.19. Again, a Perſon is a diſtinct ſubſiſting of the whole Godhead, and an individual Underſtanding, and an incommunicable Subſiſtence, living of it ſelf, and not ſuſtained by another: So that the three Perſons in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, are not three ſeveral Subſtances, but three diſtinct Subſiſtences, or three divers maner of being of one and the ſame Subſtance and Divine Eſſence. The Divine Eſſence is one and the ſelf-ſame thing, truly ſubſiſting in the three Perſons: Now the Eſſence doth not beget an Eſſence, but the Perſon of the Father begetteth the Perſon of the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt proceedeth from the Father and the Son, by an eternal and incomprehenſible ſpiration. And thus the three Perſons make all one Divine Eſſence and one God, being in Nature Coeſſential, in Dignity Coequal, in Time Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eternal, in Greatneſs Incomprehenſible, in Power Irreſiſtible, in Will Unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in Place not Circumſcript, every where preſent without ſight, the Firſt and the Laſt, without Time, making all things mutable, without any paſſive mutability in himſelf. In this Myſtery of the Trinity, how in that moſt ſimple and ſingle Eſſence of God, there ſhould be three in one, and one in three, Differing, but not divided, Several, but not ſundred, All one for their Nature, All diſtinct for their Perſons, is a ſecret of ſecrets, rather ſtedfaſtly to be believed, and reverently to be adored, then over-curiouſly to be ſearched into.</p>
                  <p>Again, in the Divine Eſſence there be three diſtinct Perſons, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt; God the Father is indeed the beginning of the Godhead, but yet in reſpect onely of the order of the Perſons: For in the Godhead we may not ſeek for any firſt or laſt in degree, or dignity, or time, but onely in order of exiſting or working: The Son is the Wiſdom of the Father, begotten of the Father before the world; The Holy Ghoſt is the infinite Power proceeding from the Father and the Son. The Scripture aſcribeth to the Father the Beginning of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; To the Son, Wiſdom and Counſel; To the Holy Ghoſt, Vertue and Power: Notwithſtanding, they be alike in all things in reſpect of Eternity, Dignity and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:97622:12"/>Power, becauſe there is one moſt undivided Divine Eſſence common to them, and ſo they be one God. <hi>There be three which bear witneſs in Heaven, the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghoſt, and theſe three be one,</hi> 1 John 5.7. And although the word <hi>Creator</hi> is given to the Father, <hi>Redeemer</hi> to the Son, and <hi>Sanctifier</hi> to the Holy Ghoſt, yet in truth they are common to all three Perſons in one Eſſence: And though the Father is ſaid to be the Firſt, the Son the Second, the Holy Ghoſt to be the Third; yet one is not more ancient then the other, as the Father more ancient then the Son, or the Son then the Holy Ghoſt, but all of a like Coeternity; for the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are one after another in order of Nature, but not of Time, <hi>John</hi> 1.1, 2. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2, 26. The things they have in common, in regard of their work, are to Create, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26. <hi>John</hi> 1.3. to Redeem and to Sanctifie, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.1. &amp; 49.7. The Creation is given to the Father, Redemption to the Son, Sanctification to the Holy Ghoſt, not as they are ſimply an operation or work (for ſo ſhould other perſons be excluded from it) but in reſpect, for the order and maner of working, which is peculiar and proper to every one of them, in producing and bringing forth the ſame external work: So that our Creation, Redemption, Sanctification, are each appropriated to ſome one Perſon of the Trinity, and yet all three Perſons have their joynt working in them: For the works of our Creation, Redemption and Sanctification, are the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Godhead outwardly, that is, external operations, which God worketh on his Creatures; and they are undivided, that is, common to the three Perſons, which they by common Will and Power work in the Creatures, by reaſon of that one and the ſame Eſſence and Nature of the Godhead, which they have; All the Perſons therefore Create, Redeem and Sanctifie. Again, Eſſence is a thing ſubſiſting by its ſelf, the very Being of God, Abſolute and Communicable; Perſon is a thing ſubſiſting, Individual, Living, Underſtanding, not ſuſtained in another, neither part of another: Eſſence is the Being of God; Perſon is the maner of this Being, which is threefold, and ſo maketh three Perſons: The Eſſence is Abſolute and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable; the Perſon Reſpective and Incommunicable.</p>
                  <p>By the name of Trinity, are underſtood the three maners of Being in God; that is, three, not Eſſences, but Perſons of the ſame Divine Eſſence. Now Trinity and Triplicity, as alſo Trinal and Triple, differ; for that is ſaid to be Triple, which is compounded of three Eſſences, or is diſtinct by three Eſſences; but Trinal is in Eſſence but one and moſt ſimple, though it hath three maners of Being. God therefore is not Triple, becauſe there are not moe Eſſences; but Trinal, becauſe he being one according to his Eſſence, is three according to his Perſons, yet ſtill but one God: So that there is one Exiſtence or Eſſence of the three, which is from none, but of it ſelf, becauſe it is but one; but the maners of the Exiſtence are three. Wherefore as concerning Exiſtence, Being or Eſſence it ſelf, the three Perſons are of themſelves; as concerning the maner of Exiſting or Being, the Father is from none, but of himſelf, the Son of the Father, the Holy Ghoſt from both; the Son begotten, the Holy Ghoſt proceeding. As it is one thing to be a Man, another thing to be a Father or a Son, yet one and the ſame is both Man and Father; but he is Man abſolutely, or in himſelf, or according to his own Nature, and Father in reſpect of another, <hi>viz.</hi> his Son. So it is one thing to be God, another thing to be the Father's Son, or the Holy Ghoſt, and yet one and the ſame is both God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; God, in reſpect of himſelf, or his own Nature; Father, in reſpect of the Son.</p>
                  <p>Now though this be alike in God and Man, that both do communicate to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, not his Perſon, but his Eſſence; yet is there an exceeding diſſimilitude in the maner whereby the Divine Eſſence being infinite, and the Humane being created and finite, is communicated to another: For in Men, in the Father and the Son the Eſſence is as diſtinct as the Perſons themſelves, the Father and the Son being not onely two perſons, but alſo two men diſtinct in Eſſences, ſo that the Father is not that man which is the Son; but in God the Perſons are ſo diſtinct, that yet the Eſſence remaineth common, one and the ſame; and therefore there are not three Gods, but the Son is the ſame God in number, which is the Father and the Holy Ghoſt.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97622:13"/>Again, in Perſons Created, he that begetteth, doth not communicate his whole Eſſence to him that is begotten, for then he ſhould ceaſe to be a man, but onely a part; but in uncreated Perſons, he that begetteth or inſpireth, communicateth his whole Eſſence to him that is begotten or proceedeth; yet ſo, that he who communicateth doth retain the ſame Eſſence, and that whole: And the Reaſon of both Differences, is, Becauſe the Eſſence of Man is finite and diviſible, but the Eſſence of God infinite and indiviſible; and therefore the Deity may, being the ſame, and whole or intire, be together both communicated and retained, whereby the Perſons are not any thing ſeparated from the Eſſence, but each of them are the very ſelf-ſame whole Eſſence of the Divinity; wherefore God or the Divine Eſſence, is the Father, is the Son, is the Holy Ghoſt. Thus the three Perſons in the Trinity are all one; one in Nature and Eſſence; one in Will and Conſent; one in Vertue and Power: what the one doth, the other doth alſo, the difference is onely in the maner of working. This Myſtery of the Trinity and Unity, was taught from the beginning of the world; howbeit, the fuller revelation of it was reſerved to the times of the Goſpel, when the light of this Truth outſhined the Sun at noon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrine of the Trinity of Perſons in the Unity of the Godhead, muſt be held &amp; retained for theſe Reaſons; <hi>viz.</hi>

                        <item>2. Becauſe among all other points of Religion, this is one of the chiefeſt, being the very foundation thereof: For it is not ſufficient for us to know God as we can conceive of him in our own imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, but we muſt know him as he hath revealed himſelf in his Word; and it is not ſufficient to Salvation to believe in God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſedly, but we muſt believe in one God diſtinct in three Perſons.</item>
                        <item>3. This Doctrine directs us in the worſhipping of God aright: For Unity in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity, is to be worſhipped; one God muſt be worſhipped in the Father, in the Son, and in the Holy Ghoſt: And if we worſhip God the Father, without the Son and the Holy Ghoſt, or the Son without the Father &amp; the Holy Ghoſt, or the Holy Ghoſt without the Father and the Son, we worſhip nothing but an Idol. Again, if we worſhip the three Perſons not as one God, but as three Gods, then likewiſe we make three Idols.</item>

                  <p>THe Word of God is the Wiſdom of God, <hi>James</hi> 3.17. concerning the truth which is according to godlineſs, being given by inſpiration of God, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. the original being from heaven, not earth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.27. and the Author thereof being God, not man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. by which Word God alone doth onely binde the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, by cauſing it in every action to excuſe for well-doing, and accuſe for ſin. Now this Word of God is the holy Scripture, in which name are to be underſtood all and onely thoſe Canonical Books of the Old and New Teſtament, of whoſe Authority was never any doubt in the Church; which we receive as Canonical, not ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the Church doth ſo receive and allow them, as for that the holy Spirit in our hearts doth teſtifie that they are from God: Touching which, this is a Truth muſt be held of us, That no part of the Canonical Scripture inſpired of God, ſuch as was committed as the Lords Treaſure to the Church, for the perpetual inſtruction thereof in Faith and Obedience, is loſt and periſhed, nor can be loſt or periſh; ſo that no one Oracle or Sentence of God can fall away. Indeed theſe ſacred Books may be deſpitefully abuſed by men many ways, but they can never be finally loſt and wholly extinguiſhed, for the works of God remain for ever and ever: And as for any ſandy Suppoſition contrary to this Truth, let the vain Suppoſer anſwer, What Error more can be convinced, what Comfort more can be received, what Vice more can be corrected, what Truth more can be publiſhed, what Grace more can be commended to the Church, out of thoſe Books which he ſo fondly ſuppoſeth to be loſt? Beware therefore of doubting of Gods Providence herein, ſhaking thereby the Faith of the Church: Whoſoever thus goes about to ſtrike at the foundation thereof, the leaſt duſt that falls from the Building, will cruſh the preſumptuous Underminer into bottomleſs deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture is a Doctrine inſpired by God, to make us wiſe unto ſalvation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. and containeth all things neceſſary (to be known and believed) for the ſalvation of man, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.31. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17. the whole being as it were compendiouſly compriſed in the Decalogue, the ſum of the Law, and in the Creed, the ſum of the Goſpel. As for all the fundamental Points of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, neceſſary to ſalvation, they, notwithſtanding the darkneſs of ſome Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries herein contained, are clearly and plainly ſet down, ſo as the humble and obedient heart may diſtinctly, without wavering and gainſaying, conceive and believe them: Thus not unfitly is the Scripture compared, in regard of the perſpicuity thereof, to a Foord over which a Lamb may wade; and in regard of the difficulty thereof, to a Sea wherein an Elephant may ſwim. Now though all things neceſſary to be known are herein contained, yet are not all literally expreſſed, as the Baptiſm of Infants and Original Sin, which notwithſtanding are diſtinctly and demonſtratively inferred thence; and ſo are all things that belong to Faith and Obedience, whatſoever we are to believe or to practice: So that the letter of the Scripture may be alledged, and yet the word of God miſſed, as by all Hereticks; and a man may ſwerve from the letter, yet alledge the true word of God; therefore it is nothing leſs then neceſſary, that we be diligently familiar, and well acquainted with this word of God. <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> tells us, The Jews knew the Scriptures as well as their own names; many of us may tell the Jews, We ſcarce know the names of the Scriptures; Moſt inexcuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Ignorance, ſad and lamentable! for we are bound to know the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that by them we may come to knowledge, by knowledge to faith, by faith to obedience, and by obedience to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Apocryphal Books (to which the Imps of <hi>Rome,</hi> as to their own Traditions, give power equal to the Canonical Scriptures) they were not penned by the Prophets the Lords Secretaries (as the Scriptures were) nor ever committed of truſt to the Iſraelites: They contain certain things diſagreeing from the true Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of God, and no proof that they were penned by the Spirit of God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97622:14"/>there is no warrant for the equalling them in Credit or Authority with the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. Beſides, one main property of the Books of the Old Teſtament, is, That every one of them was written either by <hi>Moſes</hi> or ſome other of the Prophets in the Hebrew tongue, the native language of the Jews; but the Apocryphal Books were penned by ſome other in the Greek tongue, which was not the language of the old Prophets, ſo that they are no part of the Law or of the Prophets. And yet as the preſumptuous Papiſts make the Apocryphal Books of equal Authority with the Canonical; ſo others have more blaſphemouſly long ſince obtruded for Canonical, the fatherleſs brood of other Books unto theſe; as, <hi>The third and fourth of Eſdras, An Appendix of Job, A Preface to the Lamentation, The third and fourth of the Maccabees,</hi> a Book called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>The Book of Enoch, The Goſpel of Thomas and of Matthias, The Acts of Peter;</hi> and in the year 1120, a certain new Goſpel, called <hi>Evangelium Aeternum,</hi> was found out, being full of Blaſphemies: All which and the like are damnable preſumptions, plainly forbidden by the Lord, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2. and moſt fearfully threatned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.18, 19. So then, to withſtand the Devils ſuggeſtion againſt the Divine Authority of the true ſacred Seriptures, it is very neceſſary to have our judgements well informed therein; to pray for the Spirit of Revelation or Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which may inwardly teſtifie to our Spirits, That God is the Author of the Scriptures; which Principle we muſt hold undeniable, and give no place to doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about theſe uncontradictable Truths.</p>

                        <item>1. In the Old the Church ſtood bound to the obedience of the whole Moſaical Law, Moral, Ceremonial, Civil or Judicial; in the New we are bound onely to the Spiritual or Moral worſhip, and the uſe of the Sacraments.</item>
                        <item>2. The Old was made and tyed to one certain Nation, the people of Iſrael; but the New belongeth to all Nations, the Church is Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick and Univerſal.</item>

                        <item>2. Some things are indeed, and yet are not ſaid to be expreſly; ſo that though the ſame words be not there, yet the Doctrine is; as, that the holy Ghoſt is God, that he proceedeth equally from the Father &amp; the Son, That there are two Sacraments, That Chriſt is God of himſelf, &amp; Conſubſtantial with the Father; and yet indeed theſe are there plainly enough expreſſed, though not in the ſelf-ſame, and juſt ſo many words.</item>
                        <item>3. Some things neither are, neither are ſaid to be; as, that an Image and an Idol are things different in themſelves.</item>

                        <item>2. Ignorance is the cauſe of all error, becauſe the natural man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not the things that are of God.</item>

                  <p>The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is difficult in four reſpects:
<list>
                        <item>1. In regard of the matter: Many profound and deep myſteries are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein; as, the Trinity of perſons in the Unity of the Deity, and the Hypoſtatical Union of the two Natures of Chriſt in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; yet ſo plainly opened in Scripture, as we may well believe theſe things to be ſo, though we cannot fully conceive how they ſhould be ſo.</item>
                        <item>2. In regard of the maner of writing: Many abſtruſe phraſes are therein, as divers Hebraiſms, Metaphors, Allegories, and other Tropes and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, which by diligent ſtudy of the Scriptures, and careful uſe of the means, may be found out.</item>
                        <item>3. In regard of the perſons who reade them: Natural men are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the things of the Spirit of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. he that is Spiritual diſcerneth all things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.15. for God giveth unto him the Spirit of revelation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17.</item>
                        <item>4. In regard of the maner of ſearching them; for if men curſorily &amp; careleſly reade the Scripture, no marvel if they underſtand little or nothing thereof.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is in ſome reſpects difficult:
<list>
                        <item>1. To declare unto man his natural blindeneſs, and to ſuppreſs all ſelf-conceit; for by the Myſtery of the Word, the wiſdom of man is found to be fooliſhneſs.</item>
                        <item>2. To keep holy things from dogs; and ſo to make a difference betwixt the childe of the kingdom and the wicked.</item>
                        <item>3. To maintain the divine Ordinance of Preaching and Expounding the Scriptures.</item>
                        <item>4. To raiſe up in us an appetite after the Word, and an high eſteem of it, and to keep us from loathing it: By the perſpicuity of it we are kept from ſtarving, and by the difficulty of it from loathing it.</item>
                        <item>5. To ſtir us up diligently to ſtudy and ſearch the Scriptures, and carefully to uſe the means whereby we may finde out the hidden treaſure in it.</item>
                        <item>6. To make us to call upon him who is the Author of the Scripture, to give us the Spirit of Revelation, and not to reade or hear the Word without faithful and earneſt prayer.</item>

                        <item>3. Knowledge of the Analogy of Faith, that is, of the fundamental points of our Chriſtian Religion, that no ſenſe be made contrary to any of them.</item>

                        <item>5. Comparing one place with another, as the obſcure places with the perſpicuous: Thus the meaning of many Types and Propheſies in the Old Teſtament may be underſtood, by the application of them in the New.</item>
                        <item>6. Prayer, for thereby the Spirit of Revelation is obtained, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17.</item>

Knowledge, whereby in all things that we do, we may be able to judge what is the good will of God, what is pleaſing and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.17. This knowledge is attained by diligent reading of the word, by meditation on what we reade, by a reverend conferring thereof, and by a careful humble atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the preaching thereof.</item>
                        <item>2. Wiſdom, which teacheth us rightly to apply the word, and that both in the true ſenſe and meaning of that particular place which we alledge, and alſo according to the preſent matter for which it is alledged; otherwiſe we pervert the Scripture to our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16.</item>
                        <item>3. Faith, whereto the power of the Scriptures is reſtrained; for the Word is the power of God to every one that believeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. without this all knowledge, all wiſdom is in vain.</item>
                        <item>4. Obedience; for in Religion a man knoweth no more then he practiſeth: Happy onely which ſo know, as to do what they know, <hi>John</hi> 13.17. by neither careleſly neglecting that which is commanded, nor by prepoſterouſly doing that which is forbidden.</item>

                        <item>3. Touching Families and Houſhold-affairs, in which are Husband and Wife, Parents and Children, Maſters and Servants; no duty required of them is omitted, but all contained herein.</item>

                  <head>§. 3. <hi>The Law and Goſpel.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe Law of God is a Doctrine delivered of God at the Creation, written in <hi>Adams</hi> heart, publiſhed by the Miniſtery either of Angels or of men, and afterward repeated and renewed of him by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, teaching what we ought to do, and what not to do; binding reaſonable Creatures, always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing to perfect performers of obedience, eternal life, condemning eternally them who perform not this obedience, except Remiſſion be granted for the Mediators ſake. Before the Fall, this Law was poſſible to all men, as to Angels; and if now it be impoſſible, it is our own fault, for God commanded them when they were poſſible, neither hath he loſt the right of requiring that now, which we loſt the power of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of then at our Parents firſt birth; yea, after our ſecond birth in Chriſt (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill in this life but in a ſtate of imperfection) it is impoſſible, though God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to crave and deſire of him in this life the perfect fulfilling of the Law: So that God chargeth no more upon us, then he had enabled us to do, and had given us ſtrength to perform; and if there be any impoſſibility to do it, the fault reſteth in our ſelves, and not in God: for man by his firſt Creation was able to keep the whole Law without ſinning, for he was made after Gods own Image. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>made man righteous,</hi> Eccl. 7. his heart was full of divine underſtanding, his will was altogether right, his affections holy, his power abſolute to perſiſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſuch always; but as his nature now is, he cannot keep the Law of God, neither the whole nor any parcel thereof, but is altogether corrupt, his underſtanding dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, his will crooked, his affections impure, and his beſt ſtrength weakneſs, towards the running of the race of Gods Commandments; yea, though aſſiſted by Gods grace, and regenerate, yet does not perfectly fulfil the Law, but faileth ſtill in many things: for though a man be now Spiritual, and guided by Gods Spirit not to ſin as men natural, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. yet the fleſh, the old man, corrupt Nature, is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther expelled, but remaining for their humiliation, and the exerciſe of Grace in their Spiritual combat, hindreth them from doing perfectly the thing they would,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:97622:19"/>and ſwayeth them oftentimes to the thing they would not. Thus though the Law exacteth ſuch perfect obedience, as no man in this life is able to yield, as appeareth <hi>Acts</hi> 13.38. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. &amp; 3.20. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.21. yet we muſt know, that it is impoſſible onely to Nature, but not to Grace; which is thus to be explained. It is poſſible to Grace, becauſe Grace covereth our failings, not that a man in Grace can perfectly fulfil all things.</p>
                  <p>Chriſtians are not bound at all to the obſervation of the Judaical Ceremonies; nor are the Judicial Laws of the Jews neceſſarily to be received or eſtabliſhed in any Commonwealth: yet no Chriſtian man whatſoever is freed from the obedience of the Moral Law, for that remains for ever a Rule of obedience to every childe of God, though he be not bound to bring the ſame obedience for his Juſtification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God; for he is accurſed (ſaith the Law) that faileth in any Commandment, except (ſaith the Goſpel) he be reconciled again in Chriſt, and in him have the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of his tranſgreſſions. Whence this is one main difference betwixt the Law and the Goſpel, That the Law leaveth no place to repentance, nor affordeth any means to reſume that which is loſt, or recover that which is decayed: Hear the thunder of the Law, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things which are written in the Book of the Law, to do them,</hi> Gal. 3.10. Liſten to the ſtill voyce of the Goſpel, <hi>Repent,</hi> Mat. 3.2. &amp; 4.17. <hi>Sin no more,</hi> Joh. 5.14. &amp; 8.11. <hi>Turn you, turn you from your wicked ways, for why will ye dye?</hi> Ezek. 33.11. In this reſpect the Law may be reſembled to <hi>Abiſhai,</hi> the Goſpel to <hi>David;</hi> both of them found their enemy: <hi>Abiſhai</hi> would preſently have ſmote him dead; but <hi>David</hi> wakes him, tells him the danger he was in, and adviſeth him to look better to himſelf, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.8, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus the Law ſets forth the rigor of Gods Juſtice; the Goſpel the riches of his Mercy: Now indeed a man cannot ſee his ſins to purpoſe, without the ſpirit of Bondage, for that muſt make the Law effectual, as well as the Spirit of Adoption doth the Goſpel; that is, except God himſelf preſs the Law in our hearts, the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters diſcover our ſins to no purpoſe; they may as ſoon ſhake the earth it ſelf, as the heart of a ſinner, without the work of God: therefore the firſt work of the Holy Ghoſt, is to awaken a ſinner, to ſet upon him his ſins, that he may be fit to receive Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The Law in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, is that part of Gods Word which commands things juſt, honeſt and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and being thus conceived, it is three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<list>
                        <item>1. The Ceremonial Law, concerning Ceremonies, binding the Jews until the coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that they ſhould be Signs, Symboles, Types or Shadows of Spiritual things to be fulfilled in the Goſpel of Chriſt; this Law preſcribed to the Jews Ceremonies, Rites and Orders, to be performed in the Worſhip of God; and is laid down in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> eſpecially in <hi>Leviticus:</hi> it concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Jews onely, and is now wholly abrogated.</item>
                        <item>2. The Judicial Law, which is that part of Gods Word which preſcribed Ordinances for the Government of the Jews Commonwealth, and the Civil puniſhment of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders: Indeed their whole Civil Order or Government, that is, of the Offices of Magiſtrates, Judgements, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, Contracts, and of the diſtinguiſhing and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Dominions, binding all <hi>Abrahams</hi> poſterity until the coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that they ſhould be Types of that Order which ſhould be in Chriſts Kingdom, that is, of the Spiritual Regiment of the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> This did indeed principally concern the Jews; but yet ſo far forth as it tendeth to the eſtabliſhing of the Moral Law, having in it common Equity, it concerneth all people, in all times and places.</item>
                        <pb n="17" facs="tcp:97622:19"/>
                        <item>3. The Moral Law, which teacheth us what to do, and what not to do, binding all reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creatures to perfect obedience, both internal and external; ſo that it may fully be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in theſe three points:

                              <item>1.

                              <item>2. It commandeth perfect obedience, both inward in thought and affection, and outward in ſpeech and action.</item>
                              <item>3. It bindeth to the curſe and puniſhment every one that faileth in the leaſt duty thereof, though but once, and that in thought onely, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. The ſum of the Moral Law is propounded in the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue or Ten Commandments, which many can repeat, but few do underſtand.</item>

                        <item>2. In the ſcope and ſubſtance of it, which is Chriſt crucified, with his benefits, whom it ſhadowed out; thus it remaineth ſtill, and is now more plain then ever it was.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law ceaſed at the coming of Chriſt, for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
<list>
                        <item>1. There is no more uſe of a candle when the Sun is riſen, nor of the picture when the perſon is preſent: Thus was it between the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaical Ceremonies and Chriſt.</item>
                        <item>2. The renting of the vail of the Temple at Chriſts ſuffering, and the deſtruction thereof not long after, ſhew the ſame.</item>
                        <item>3. Chriſt was a new High Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedeck,</hi> who was greater then <hi>Aaron,</hi> and therefore his order was to ceaſe at the coming of this worthier.</item>
                        <item>4. Chriſts coming made us to be of age, when as before men were chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and nothing differing from ſervants.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>Again, the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial and Civil, or Judicial Laws, are wholly abrogated as touching obedience, ſo that there is no neceſſity any more of obſerving them:
<list>
                        <item>1. Becauſe they were to continue onely unto the coming of the <hi>Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, Gen.</hi> 49.10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.14.</item>
                        <item>2. Becauſe the <hi>Meſſias</hi> being exhibited, the Types ceaſe, ſuch as were the Ceremonial Laws, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.17. yet is not the Moral Law in like maner abrogated; for this after Chriſt was exhibited, ceaſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as touching the curſe and conſtraint, but not as touching obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: for Chriſt fulfilled not the Law, and redeemed us from the curſe of it, that we ſhould continue and perſiſt in ſins and enmity with God.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The uſe of the Ceremonial and Judicial Laws, againſt Anaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſts that would ſhut the Old Teſtament out of the Church of Chriſt, and under pretence of his Spirit, be a Law unto themſelves:
<list>
                        <item>1. The firſt and principal uſe of the Ceremonial and Judicial Laws of <hi>Moſes,</hi> was to ſerve as a Schoolmaſter unto Chriſt and his Kingdom.</item>
                        <item>2. By theſe God would have his own people ſorted out from others, for his own glory and their ſalvation.</item>
                        <item>3. Obedience, or the obſerving of the Moral Ordinances.</item>
                        <item>4. An exerciſe and a teſtification of their obedience towards God.</item>
                        <item>5. Unto moſt of the ceremonies, ſuch as ſignifi'd Chriſts benefits, was proper &amp; peculiar the ſealing of Gods Covenant, or the confirmation of faith, to ſignifie what benefits God would give by the <hi>Meſſias</hi> to believers.</item>
                        <item>6. They ſerved for the preſervation of that Moſaical Regiment until the coming of the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>7. Although they are now ſo aboliſhed, as the obſervation of them is not now required as concerning the Types, yet theſe things are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, which are ſignified by them, and therefore are a confirmation of the new Teſtament, as well as the Oracles &amp; Propheſies of the old, concerning the <hi>Meſſias</hi> &amp; his kingdom, for types are viſible promiſes.</item>
                     </list>

<list>
                        <item>1. The Moral Law is known by Nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. and from the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe Men and Angels were created according to the Image of God: The Ceremonial and Judicial Laws are not known by Nature, but are inſtituted according to the diverſity of cauſes and circumſtances.</item>
                        <item>2. The Moral Law was publiſhed and written by God himſelf, and uſing the mediation of Angels, which was not altogether ſo with the other Laws.</item>
                        <item>3. The Moral Law bindes all men, and in part the Angels alſo; the Ceremonial and Judicial Laws were onely preſcribed unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. The Moral Law was firſt given as moſt worthy, the other after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as not ſo much to be regarded in reſpect of it.</item>
                        <item>5. The Laws of the Decalogue are perpetual, the other were deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered at a certain time, and again aboliſhed. Thus the Moral Law engraven in Tables of Stone, was kept in the Ark, which was a ſign that it ſhould laſt perpetually, but the other Laws were to laſt onely to the fulfilling of all by Chriſt.</item>
                        <item>6. The Moral Laws ſpeak of both internal and external obedience, the other of external onely; albeit, neither doth this pleaſe God, without the internal and moral obedience.</item>
                        <item>7. The Moral Laws are not limited by certain circumſtances, but are general, the Ceremonial and Civil Laws are more ſpecial.</item>
                        <item>8. The Ceremonial Law hath been oftentimes broken without ſin, but the Moral Law never without ſome ſpecial countermand from God, as when <hi>Abraham</hi> was bid to kill his Son, and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to rob the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> Exod. 12.36.</item>
                        <item>9. The Ceremonial and Civil Laws are types or figures of other things, for whoſe cauſe they were ordained; the Moral ſignifie or prefigure nothing, but are ſignified by the Rites and Ceremonies.</item>
                        <item>10. The Moral Law being neglected, maketh men worſe then Infidels, yea then bruit beaſts, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.3. but the Ceremonial neglected, made men onely worſe then the ſervants and peculiar people of God.</item>
                        <item>11. The Moral are the principal ſervice and worſhip of God: The Ceremonial and Civil ſerve for the Moral Ordinances, that obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to them be rightly performed.</item>
                        <item>12. The Ceremonial Law was very chargeable and coſtly, burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and grievous; but the Moral Law requireth onely the right diſpoſition of the heart, and then obedience in practice will eaſily follow.</item>
                        <item>13. The Ceremonial give place unto the Moral; the Moral give not place unto the Ceremonial.</item>

                        <item>2. The Natural Law doth not differ from the Moral in nature not corrupted, but in nature corrupted; a good part of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Law is darkned by ſins, and but a little part, onely concerning the obedience due to God, was left remaining after the Fall; for which cauſe God hath in his Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated again, and declared the whole Sentence and Doctrine of the Law.</item>

                  <p>The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Law and the Goſpel:
<list>
                        <item>1. In the maner of their Manifeſtation: The Law is known by Nature; the Goſpel was manifeſted from above: the Law is Natural, and was in mans Nature before the Fall; but the Goſpel is Spiritual, revealed after the Fall in the Covenant of Grace.</item>
                        <item>2. In their Matter or Doctrine: The Law teacheth us what to do and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; the Goſpel teacheth how we may be ſuch in Chriſt.</item>
                        <item>3. In their Promiſes: The Law promiſes eternal life and all good things, with a condition of our own proper and perfect righteouſneſs and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience remaining in us; the Goſpel promiſeth the ſame with a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Faith in Chriſt, whereby we embrace his obedience performed for us. Now with this condition of Faith is joyned by an indiſſoluble knot and bond, the condition of new-obedience. Thus the Law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth life to the worker and doer of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.5. but the Goſpel offereth ſalvation to him that worketh not, but believeth him that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the ungodly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. not conſidering Faith as a work, but as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument apprehending Chriſt, by whom we are made righteous. So the Law ſets forth Gods Juſtice in rigor, without Mercy; but the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel ſets out Juſtice and Mercy united in Chriſt: therefore the Law is called the Miniſtery of condemnation and of death, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7, 9. but the Goſpel ſhews mercy to mans ſins in and by Chriſt, if we repent and believe. Thus the Law requireth a perfect righteouſneſs within us, but the Goſpel revealeth our acceptance with God by imputed righteouſneſs.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>In like maner the difference between the Righteouſneſs of the Law &amp; that of Faith, ſtands thus:
<list>
                        <item>1. The Law requireth it of our ſelves; but Faith calleth us from our ſelves to ſeek it in Chriſt.</item>
                        <item>2. The Law requireth us to obſerve and do all that it commandeth, otherwiſe it threatneth the curſe; but Faith requireth onely that we truly believe.</item>
                        <item>3. The righteouſneſs of the Law coming from our ſelves, ſhould ſet up Merit and put away Grace; but that of Faith which is from God, taketh away Merit, and ſetteth up Grace.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>As there is a double keeping of the Law,
<list>
                        <item>1. A ſtrict and exact keeping of it.</item>
                        <item>2. An Evangelical keeping of it, that is, when we deſire and endeavor to fulfil the Law in all things.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>So according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is a double curſe:
<list>
                        <item>1. A curſe that follows the breach of the Moral Law, that belongs to all mankinde till they be in Chriſt.</item>
                        <item>2. An Evangelical curſe that follows upon the Evangelical breach of the Law. This is the curſe of the Goſpel, which cannot be repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and is more terrible then the curſe of the Law.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which curſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in four things:

                        <item>2. A ſeperation from the preſence of God, that is, from the joy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and protection of God.</item>
                        <item>3. A curſe on the outward eſtate, wherein a man may be curſed in the midſt of plenty.</item>
                        <item>4. The eternal curſe at the day of Judgement: And in this fourfold curſe we muſt note, that men may be curſed, though the curſe be not executed.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>Though no man can perfectly keep the Law, yet is it of moſt excellent uſe theſe three ways:
<list>
                        <item>1. To humble us, in regard of our miſerable eſtate hereby diſcovered.</item>
                        <item>2. To be a Rule of good life unto us.</item>
                        <item>3. To be a Schoolmaſter to bring us unto Chriſt, driving us unto him as our onely Refuge, to be made righteous by faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.24.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>God willeth us to deſire in this life the perfect fulfilling of the Law, for theſe Reaſons:
<list>
                        <item>1. Becauſe in thoſe that deſire it, he will at length effectuate it hereafter.</item>
                        <item>2. That we may now go forward in godlineſs, according to Gods rule.</item>
                        <item>3. That by this deſire of fulfilling the Law, God may exerciſe us in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Obedience.</item>

                  </p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:97622:21"/>
                  <p>This perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is here two ways to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood:
<list>
                        <item>1. As it is oppoſed to imperfections and wants, and this is perfection of degrees, whereby the Law is kept without failing in any thing: Thus no man can keep the Law.</item>
                        <item>2. As it is oppoſed to hypocriſie, and this is called perfection of parts, whereby what is outwardly profeſſed, is inwardly embraced, ſo that as the outward part maketh a good ſhew, the inward part is alſo right and ſincere: Thus <hi>David, Joſiah</hi> and others are ſaid to be perfect, and not otherwiſe; and thus every regenerate man can and doth approve himſelf in ſome meaſure for perfect, though amidſt great weakneſſes.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, a man may be ſaid to be perfect
<list>
                        <item>1. Comparatively, in regard of others that are more imperfect.</item>
                        <item>2. In endeavor, when a man ſetteth himſelf ſo much as poſſibly he can to keep, not ſome, but all and every of the Commandments of God.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>Though the Law is impoſſible even to the regenerate in reſpect of God, that is, as touching the perfect inward and outward obedience of the Law, yet is the Law thus poſſible to them, and them onely:
<list>
                        <item>1. As concerning outward Order and Diſcipline.</item>
                        <item>2. By the benefits of Juſtification and Regeneration, both which we obtain by Faith.</item>
                        <item>3. As touching the beginning of inward and outward obedience in this life, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.3. and as concerning the imputation of Chriſts Righteouſneſs.</item>

                        <item>2. The <hi>Sadduces,</hi> who did expound the Law according to the letter and ſyllable, and withal denyed the Reſurrection and Immortality of the Soul, as appears <hi>Acts</hi> 2.3, 8.</item>
                        <item>3. The <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who did forſake the common Expoſition of the Scribes, and taught and framed a more exact and ſtrict Expoſition of the Law, according to the Traditions of the Fathers: Theſe Phariſees were by office Scribes, as appears by comparing <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29. with <hi>ver.</hi> 24.</item>
                        <item>4. <hi>Herodians,</hi> who (as ſome think) were Courtiers, who held and taught that <hi>Herod</hi> was the <hi>Meſſias.</hi>

                  <p>The Church of Rome erreth groſly in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founding the Law and the Goſpel, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that the Precepts of both are the ſame for ſubſtance; that both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire righteouſneſs, both promiſe life &amp; threaten death; both command faith, repentance and obedience: Put his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion overturns true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and is erroneous, for theſe Reaſons:
<list>
                        <item>1. <hi>Adam</hi> in his innocency knew the Law, but he knew nothing then of believing, in Chriſt; and though both require righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, promiſe life and threaten death, yet the maner is far different.</item>
                        <item>2. Likewiſe they differ in the commanding of faith; for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel commandeth faith, not as a work done, as the Law doth, but as an inſtrument laying hold on Chriſt. Again, the Law commands faith generally, as to believe in God, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his word to be true; but beſides this, the Goſpel requires a particular faith in Chriſt the Redeemer, whom the Law ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver knew.</item>
                        <item>3. The Law commandeth not Repentance, for the knowledge of the Law was in <hi>Adams</hi> heart, when he needed no Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: True Repentance therefore is a ſaving Grace, wrought and commanded onely by the Goſpel.</item>
                        <pb n="23" facs="tcp:97622:22"/>
                        <item>4. Though obedience be commanded both by the Law and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, yet not in the ſame maner: The Law commandeth obedience every way perfect, both in parts and in degrees, and alloweth no other; but the Goſpel in Chriſt approveth imperfect obedience, that is, an endeavor in all things to obey and pleaſe God, if it be without hypocriſie. Again, the Law commandeth obedience as a work to be done for the obtaining of ſalvation, but the Goſpel requires obedience, onely to teſtifie our faith and thankfulneſs to God.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is not the onely Error touching the Law; there are certain people in the world, living under a Chriſtian Climate, known by the Name of <hi>New-Libertines,</hi> who ſay, The Old Teſtament is abrogated; others think us neceſſarily tyed to all the Judicials of <hi>Moſes;</hi> boldly affirming, That the Laws Judicial of <hi>Moſes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long as well unto Chriſtians, as they did unto the Jews: Others have entertained an Opinion, That Love was now come in the place of the Ten Commandments: Others will not have Gods Law to be preached, nor the Conſcience of ſinners to be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified and troubled with the Judgements of God; yea, it hath been held, How that it was utterly unlawful for the Elect, ſo much as to think, much leſs to ſpeak or hear of the fear of God which the Law preacheth. Now the common Objection of ſuch men is, That Chriſtians are not ruled by the Law, but by the Spirit of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according as it is ſaid, <hi>Ye are not under the Law, but under Grace.</hi> Again, the Law is not given unto the righteous man, therefore it is not to be taught in the Church of Chriſt. But the Anſwer hereto is as ancient as the Error; Chriſtians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are not ruled, that is, are not compelled and conſtrained by the Law and fear of puniſhment unto whatſoever Diſcipline or Order, like as are the wicked; but yet they are taught and inſtructed by the Law of God, what worſhip is pleaſing unto God: and the Holy Ghoſt uſeth the voyce of the Law, to teach and incline them to an obedience, not conſtrained or hypocritical, but true or voluntary; ſo that not onely the Law commandeth them what to do, but the Spirit alſo of Grace doth give them ability to obey: For this is not to be under the Law, and the Law not to be given to the righteous; ſo that the Bond and Doctrine remaineth, although the Condemnation and Conſtraint be taken away. Let no Chriſtian man whatſoever therefore think that he is freed from the obedience of the Moral Law; for the compleatneſs and perfection of our wiſdom and ſalvation which we have in Chriſt, doth not exclude, but include rather and comprehend the Doctrine of the Law: Think not that Chriſt came to deſtroy the Law or the Prophets; no, he came not to deſtroy, but to fulfil them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17. neither think that we make the Law of none effect through faith, for thereby we eſtabliſh the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.3. which ſheweth us what is to be done; and the Goſpel, by the Spirit of Regeneration, miniſtreth unto us power both to will and to do.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>Goſpel</hi> ſignifieth Good tidings; but it is generally taken for that Doctrine which containeth the Promiſe of forgiveneſs of ſins to the penitent, and life everlaſting, made unto us of God in the Word by his Son. It is the Doctrine made manifeſt of God by his Son the Mediator, preſently after the fall of mankinde into ſin and death, promiſing all believing and repentant ſinners remiſſion of ſins, and their receiving into favor and life everlaſting, freely to be granted through and for his Son the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator: By which Doctrine the Holy Ghoſt doth forcibly kindle and work in the hearts of the choſen, faith, repentance, and the beginning of everlaſting life. This Goſpel is the Key which openeth the Kingdom of Heaven to all Believers, and ſhutteth it againſt Unbelievers; when by the commandment of Chriſt it is publikely declared to all and every one of the faithful, that all their ſins are pardoned them for the Merit of Chriſt, ſo often as they embrace by a lively faith the Promiſe of the Goſpel; but on the other ſide it is denounced to all Infidels and Hypocrites, That ſo long the wrath of God and everlaſting damnation doth lie on them, as they perſiſt
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:97622:23"/>in their wickedneſs, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.23. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.19. according to which Teſtimony of the Goſpel God will judge them, as well in this life as in the life to come.</p>
                  <p>This Goſpel was firſt made known in Paradice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. and afterward God did ſpread it abroad by the the Patriarchs and Prophets, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.18. &amp; 49.10, 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.2. ſhadowed it by Sacrifices and other Ceremonies of the Law, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.46. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.7. and laſtly accompliſhed it by his onely begotten Son, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.4. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. All thoſe things which are promiſed us in the Goſpel, are neceſſary for a Chriſtian man to believe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.31. the ſum whereof is briefly compriſed in the Creed of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, or the Articles of the Catholick and undoubted Faith of all Chriſtians. So that theſe Promiſes of the Goſpel are limited with the condition of Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, being indefinite in regard of whole mankinde, and univerſal onely to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; and therefore men are not brought within the Covenant by the ſuppoſed Doctrine of Univerſal Grace and Redemption: for had there always in the Old Teſtament ſuch an Univerſal Grace been given to all, whereby they might be ſaved if they would, they would never have thought ſo groſly of God as ſome of them did; nor could the Heathen have had ſuch carnal conceits of God as we finde they had, had they had but one ſpark of true knowledge of the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> and therefore howſoever the Heathen had ſo much knowledge of God, as made them without excuſe, yet we are to hold, That before Chriſts coming they were left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and forſaken of God in his juſt Judgement, in regard of his ſpecial grace and favor; yea, in the firſt Age of the world there were ſome that were the ſons of God, others the daughters of men, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.2. After the Flood, ſome the children of the Fleſh, others the children of the Promiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.29. And under the Law, a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and no people, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.10. which diſtinction of man and man, people and people, could not be, were the opinion of Univerſal Grace otherwiſe then falſe and erroneous. The Goſpel indeed, which is that part of Gods Word touching remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins and ſalvation, is by our Savior commanded to be preached to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and though the Promiſes therein contained are near us, yet unleſs God clear them, we ſee them no more then <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> did Jeſus, though he ſtood near enough to her, or the Diſciples with whom he converſed on the way, or <hi>Hagar</hi> the Well, till their eyes were open; but to as many as are Gods choſen, this his ſoft voyce, or the voyce of the Goſpel, is ſaid to be a clearing of the Promiſes, and the immediate Teſtimony of the Spirit, both which alway go together, and are never disjoyned; and to them onely doth God impute for perfect righteouſneſs the Merit of Chriſt ſet forth in this Goſpel, and reſtoreth ſalvation unto them, for that in them alone he obtaineth the end both of his Creation, and of his delivery and Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, even his praiſe and glory, for they onely acknowledge this benefit of God, and yield thanks unto him for it, the reſt deſpiſe it.</p>

                  <p>The proper effects of the Goſpel are faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.17. &amp; 1.16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.8. and our whole converſion unto God, Juſtification, Regeneration and Salvation, which are the effects of faith: And herein the Goſpel mainly differs from the Law; for the Law is the Miniſtery of death, and killeth; but the Goſpel is the Miniſtery of life and of the Spirit, that is, it hath the forcible operation of the Holy Ghoſt adjoyned, and quickneth. The Law by it ſelf without the Goſpel, is onely the letter, that is, the outward preaching, and bare knowledge of thoſe things which we ought to do; teaching indeed our duty, and that righteouſneſs which God requireth at our hands, but not enabling us to perform that righteouſneſs, neither ſhewing us any hope to attain thereunto by another, but rather accuſing and condemning our unrighteouſneſs; but the Goſpel is the inſtrument of the Holy Ghoſt, which he properly uſeth to kindle faith in us, whereby we who before were dead are again quickned, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſtrength to perform the Law: For through faith in Chriſt our Mediator the Law ceaſeth to be unto us the Miniſtery of death, and is become Spiritual, that is, the inſtrument of the Holy Ghoſt, whereby he forcibly moveth our hearts to ſerve God.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>IT hath been accounted State-policy to defend little Preaching and leſs Hearing, but Ignorance can uphold no Kingdom: Religion and the knowledge of it, is the Pillar both of Church and State; the want whereof is the cauſe of Tumults, Inſurrections and Seditions: True Religion is a Bulwark and a Caſtle of Defence to any Kingdom, the very chariots and horſemen of Iſrael, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.12. Now the Preaching of the Word of God, is properly the Expounding of ſome part thereof, teaching hence the duties to be followed, and the ſins to be avoided, and exhorting to do accordingly; ſo that every diſcourſe upon a Text of Scripture is not Preaching; but he that ſo Expoundeth and applyeth the Word, that his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery may be as ſalt unto his hearers, he it is that Preacheth the Word indeed: And they who may Preach this Word of God, are onely ſuch as are outwardly ſent of God ordinarily; and when extraordinary neceſſity requireth, then all ſuch as are inwardly ſtirred up and enabled thereto by the Spirit of God. The Word Preached by the inward operation of Gods holy Spirit, is the ordinary means of working in our hearts Faith, the inſtrument of our Juſtification and Salvation; and this Word thus working Faith, is the Goſpel: For the Law driveth to deſpair, but the Goſpel erecteth by Hope, the Law threatneth and filleth with fear, the Goſpel promiſeth and filleth with comfort; the Law ſheweth our miſerable eſtate, and what need we have of a Savior, the Goſpel ſheweth a remedy againſt this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and pointeth out unto us our Savior.</p>
                  <p>The Preaching of the Word, and the Adminiſtration of the Sacraments, are all
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:97622:24"/>one in ſubſtance; for in the one the will of God is ſeen, in the other heard: which ought to be diſpenſed purely, plainly and ſincerely, without the mixture of humane Inventions. This was <hi>Pauls</hi> ſpecial care, <hi>My word and my preaching</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſtood not in the inticing ſpeech of mans wiſdom, but in plain evidence of the Spirit and of power, that your faith ſhould not be in the wiſdom of men, but in the power of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.4, 5. Indeed there is a place for Arts and Tongues, and humane learning, with every diſpenſer of the Word, wherein he may uſe them with great commendation, as in his private preparation, but not in the publike diſpenſation, whereby he ſeaſoneth mens hearts unto God; that the Word of God alone muſt do, for to it alone belongs the Promiſe of the Spirit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.21. and therefore muſt he uſe great diſcretion in this Miniſtery, endeavoring ſo to ſpeak, that the Spirit may take delight to accompany the ſame; otherwiſe he may diſcourſe a year of Sabbaths, till he hath made his Lungs dryer then his matter, yet all will be to as vain a purpoſe as his humane wiſdom was; for that onely is true preaching, which expels the natural ignorance of mans heart, and gives this light of knowledge to the minde and conſcience, which leadeth men unto God. Again, Miniſters in diſpenſing Gods Word, muſt content themſelves with the Teſtimony of Scripture alone, for the end of the Miniſtery is to work and confirm Faith, and to ſettle and build up the Conſcience in the truth of Religion, and matters concerning Salvation, which no other word can do, ſave onely the Word of God in Scripture, that hath ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient authority in it ſelf, from which Conſcience cannot appeal.</p>

                        <item>3. Such as are teachers and not doers, do ſeduce the people, pulling down by the left hand of evil life, faſter then they build up by the right hand of wholeſom Doctrine.</item>

                        <item>2. They have the example of God, he is patient and beareth long with the veſſels of wrath, as Chriſt ſaith of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Mat. 23.37.</item>

                        <item>3. Idle and unprofitable; which clothe themſelves with the fleece of Chriſts flock, but feed not his ſheep: Idle perſons in any Society are thieves, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.28. Surely then theſe perſons are ſacrilegious ones, incurring the juſt rebuke of Spiritual theft and felony.</item>
                        <item>4. Unskilful; not being able to divide the word of Truth aright, yet uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pulpit, not to preach, but to abuſe the place, the people, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the Word, nay God himſelf.</item>
                        <item>5. Scandalous, who pull down with one hand faſter then they build with another; they wait indeed at Gods Altar, but are the ſervants of Satan.</item>
                        <item>6. Flattering teachers, that few pillows on every elbow, dawbing with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper'd morter; they preach to pleaſe men, and are afraid of diſpleaſing.</item>

                        <item>2. They muſt obſerve what fruit and effect the Word hath with them, whether it work reformation of life in them or not.</item>
                        <item>3. Having waited for their converſion, they muſt labor to convince their very Conſciences of the truth which in heart and life they deny; but if after all this, they give evident ſigns of malicious and obſtinate enmity againſt the Word, ſcorning and railing at the Doctrine of God, and on the Miniſters thereof, then are they to be caſt out by the Church, and to be barr'd from the word of life, until they repent.</item>

                        <item>2. The Church muſt take notice what her power and authority is in chooſing of Miniſters; it hath no abſolute authority to ordain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy men, and obtrude them on the people.</item>
                        <item>3. The people muſt ſo demean themſelves toward their faithful Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, as that they may have occaſion to rejoyce in their Calling and charge over them, that they may ſee they have not labored in vain, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17.</item>

                        <item>5. We ought to be ready to hear and obey in all things delivered and made known unto us out of the word, not ſingling out what we liſt in part to follow, and caſt the reſt from us.</item>
                        <item>6. We muſt love them ſincerely and heartily; this will cauſe reverence and regard of them, we muſt account them as our Spiritual fathers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15.</item>

                  <head>§. 5. <hi>The Word Heard.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>AS the contempt of the Word is an abridgement of all ſin gathered together in one; ſo the practical embracement thereof, is the powerfulleſt Antidote againſt the poyſon of any ſin: Practice muſt be ever joyned with knowledge of the word, for <hi>not the hearers of the Law, but the doers thereof ſhall be juſtified before God,</hi> Rom. 2.12. And ſuch as are hearers onely, and not doers of the Word, deceive but their own ſouls, <hi>James</hi> 1.22. Yea, when in admiration at Chriſts Doctrine, ſhe that bare him was pronounced Bleſſed, he replies, <hi>Nay, rather bleſſed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it,</hi> Luke 11.27, 28. So that it is not (as our lives ſeem to maintain) the ſitting and hearing, and after repeating of the Sermon, which God onely requires; for to hear as God would have us hear, is another thing: It is like the Leſſons in Muſick, which we have never learnt till we be able to practice. To un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what Faith is, what Love is, what Patience is, is nothing; but to have Faith, to have Love, to have Patience, is the true hearing. Since then it is our duty to live in the practice of that we hear, be it our duty alſo to pray to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the name of Chriſt, That he would vouchſafe his Spirit unto us, whereby our hearts may be enclined, diſpoſed and bent to an unfained love and obedience of his Precepts delivered in his Word; yea, our prayers muſt be for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of ſuch obedience in our life, as that our Conſciences may not onely not accuſe us, but alſo excuſe us before God in regard thereof, or at leaſt in regard of our true endeavor and deſire to obey. But diſobedience to the Word (which in its kinde God hateth as the ſin of Witchcraft) is the common ſin of this Age; men content themſelves with the bare action of hearing, like the Papiſts, who think God is well ſerved with the work done: but the work is not indeed done, till we conſcionably practice what we hear. Thus the principal thing we omit, which is the treaſuring up of Gods Word in our hearts, that upon juſt occaſion we might practice the ſame; yea, which is yet more deplorable, we are ſo far from yielding conſcionable obedience to the Word, that the endeavor thereunto is commonly judged Superfluous niceneſs, and over-curious preciſeneſs: Which moſt damnable Cenſure, together with this ſin of hearing and not doing, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue (as it hath brought already) many fearful Judgements upon us, unleſs by timely true Repentance it be cut off; yea, this very Word which God hath gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly ordained as the ordinary means of our Salvation, if now heard unpractiſed, will one day prove the ſavor of death to our eternal Condemnation. Conſider this therefore, thou that centreſt Religion in Formality; conſider it ſeriouſly, as thou expecteſt Heaven or feareſt Hell; for being now premoniſhed, this very ſubject thou now readeſt ſtands on Record againſt thee to the great and terrible Day of Judgement.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>SAcraments are ſacred Signs and Seals ſet before our eyes, and ordained of God for this cauſe, That he may declare and ſeal by them the Promiſe of his Goſpel unto us; which is, That he giveth freely Remiſſion of ſins and life everlaſting, not onely to all in general, but to every one in particular that believeth, for that onely Sacrifice of Chriſt which he accompliſhed upon the Croſs: I ſay, They are ſacred Signs and Seals object to our eyes, ordained and inſtituted of God, that by them he might the more declare and ſeal the promiſe of his Goſpel unto us. Now a Sign and a Seal differ one from another, as a general thing from a thing more ſpecial; for every Seal is a Sign, but not every Sign a Seal: A Seal cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifieth and confirmeth a thing, a Sign onely ſheweth: Sacraments therefore ſerve in the ſame ſtead that Pledges do; for both they ſignifie that there is ſomething pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed unto us, and withal they aſſure and confirm the ſame unto us, in regard where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is added that they are Seals. So the nature of the Sacraments is, That the Signs be underſtood corporally, that the things ſignified muſt be taken Spiritually, and that the viſible things be not the ſignified things, but onely Signs and Pledges of them.</p>
                  <p>Believers under the Goſpel have onely two Sacraments or Signs of the Covenant, that is, Baptiſm, ſucceeding Circumciſion, and the Supper of the Lord, prefigured by the Paſchal Lamb; and both theſe preach Faith, that to our outward ſenſes, which the Goſpel doth to our underſtandings; being Sacramental Rites ordained of God in the Church, to be adjoyned to the Preaching of the word, that the Promiſes of God made therein may be confirmed in us more and more: For Chriſt committed the Office of adminiſtring the Sacraments to them alone, to whom the Preaching of the word is committed, without the which the Sacraments ought not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, for they be Seals of it; and the end both of the Word and Sacraments is to lead our Faith unto the Sacrifice of Chriſt finiſhed on the Croſs, as to the onely ground of our Salvation, the Holy Ghoſt teaching us as much by the one, and aſſuring us it by the other. For as by Baptiſm God doth witneſs that we be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of him into Covenant, through the communion of Chriſt and his gifts: So
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:97622:31"/>by the Supper he aſſureth us that we be held and kept in, until we be received into the heavenly life; yet hath not God tyed his Grace to the Sacraments, ſo that the want of Baptiſm doth not condemn, but the contempt of it. And this Covenant between God and man, is a mutual Promiſe and Agreement made by our Mediator, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by ſolemn Tokens (which are theſe Sacraments) whereby God bindeth himſelf to remit their ſins unto them that believe, and to give unto them ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, for and by his Son our Mediator; and men binde themſelves to receive this ſo great a benefit with true Faith, and to yield true obedience unto God.</p>
                  <p>The matter ſigned and ſignified in both Sacraments is Jeſus Chriſt, the Covenant of God, and the Righteouſneſs of Faith according to the Promiſe of the Goſpel; the Signs being, as was ſaid, appointed of God to be as his Seals to confirm and aſſure us, That he will give us according to his Promiſe, the things which are ſignified and aſſured unto us by them: The Rites and Ceremonies which are not commanded, or are not inſtituted to this end, as to be Signs and Tokens of the Promiſe of Grace, are not Signs and Tokens of the Church; for a Sign can confirm nothing, but by his Conſent and Promiſe from whom the thing promiſed and ſignified is expected and looked for; no Creature therefore can inſtitute any Signs or Pledges of Gods will: And if in a Sacrament any other then the right outward Sign be uſed, or though the right outward Sign be uſed, yet if it be changed into the inward grace, it ceaſeth to be a Sacrament: The right uſe therefore of the Sacraments, is then when as the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful keep thoſe Rites which God hath commanded, to thoſe ends for which the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were inſtituted by God; The inſtitution conſiſteth in the Rites, Perſons and Ends, the violating whereof breedeth an abuſe.</p>
                  <p>Sacraments are as it were viſible words; in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution whereof, three things are to be obſerved:
<list>
                        <item>1. The Signs and Sacramental Rites.</item>
                        <item>2. The Spiritual and inviſible things ſignified by the Signs.</item>
                        <item>3. The Analogy or Agreement of the Signs with the thing ſignified.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Three conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons required in true Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:
<list>
                        <item>1. That they be ordained of God.</item>
                        <item>2. That there be a Commandment of God for us to uſe them.</item>
                        <item>3. That there be alſo a Promiſe, by the which it is aſſured that we ſhall be partakers of the things that are repreſented by them.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Or thus; God alone hath Authority to inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute and ordain a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on containeth two things
<list>
                        <item>1. The appointing and commanding of the Rites and Ceremonies.</item>
                        <item>2. The Promiſe of Grace annexed to this Rite, whereby God promiſeth that he will give the thing ſignified unto ſuch as lawfully and rightly uſe the Sign, that is, with Faith and Repentance.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, the conditions required in a Sacrament of the New Teſtament properly ſo called, are theſe:
<list>
                        <item>1. It muſt have for the original cauſe, Chriſt inſtituting.</item>
                        <item>2. For the matter and form, a viſible Sign or Element, and an audible form of words.</item>
                        <item>3. For the end and benefit of it, it is a Seal of ſaving Graces.</item>
                        <item>4. For the extent of it, it muſt be common and neceſſary to all Chriſtians, of what degree ſoever, at one time or another.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>In Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments the Signs differ from the things ſignified:
<list>
                        <item>1. In ſubſtance; for the Signs are Corporeal, Viſible, Earthly; the things ſignified, are Heavenly, Inviſible, Spiritual.</item>
                        <item>2. In the maner of receiving; the Signs are received by parts of the Body, and therefore alſo of unbelievers; the things ſignified are received by Faith onely and the Spirit, and therefore of the faithful onely.</item>
                        <item>3. In the end or uſe; the things ſignified are given for the poſſeſſing of life eternal, they are indeed ſome part of the beginning thereof: The Signs are received for the Sealing and Confirming of our faith concerning the things themſelves.</item>
                        <item>4. The things ſignified are neceſſary, and neceſſarily received of all the Members of the true Church: The Signs are received onely of them who are able to receive them.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:97622:31"/>
                  <p>To the difference of Sacraments from other ſacred things, apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain theſe two properties:
<list>
                        <item>1. That they are ordained and inſtituted of God.</item>
                        <item>2. That they are inſtituted to this end, that God may by them ſeal and aſſure unto us his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments do differ from the Word, in theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. In ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance &amp; nature; as thus:
<list>
                              <item>1. Words ſignifie according to the appointment of men, whom it pleaſed that things ſhould be ſo expreſſed and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified: Signs ſignifie according to a ſimilitude which they have with the things ſignified.</item>
                              <item>2. Words we hear and reade; Signs we perceive by feeling, ſeeing and taſting.</item>
                              <item>3. Words ſignifie onely; Symboles and Signs confirm alſo.</item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. In the Perſons; for the word of the Promiſe and Commandment is propoſed, without any difference, to all; To the unregenerate, that they may either begin to believe and be regenerate, or may be left without excuſe; to the regenerate, that they may the more believe and be confirmed: The Sacraments are given onely to the members of the Church. The Word is preached to all at once; the Sacraments are given to every member ſeverally.</item>
                        <item>3. In their Uſe; for the word is the inſtrument of the Holy Ghoſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he beginneth and confirmeth our Faith: therefore the Sacraments muſt follow the word: The Sacraments are the inſtruments of the Holy Ghoſt, whereby he beginneth not, but onely confirmeth our Faith, and therefore the word is to go before them.</item>
                        <item>4. In their Neceſſity; the word is neceſſary and ſufficient unto Salvation in them who are of an underſtanding age, for Faith cometh by hearing: but the Sacraments are not preciſely and abſolutely neceſſary unto all, for not the want, but the contempt of them condemneth.</item>
                        <item>5. In the Maner of working; the Sacraments by geſture, the Word by ſpeech declareth unto us the will of God.</item>
                        <item>6. The Word may be without the Sacraments, as both in private and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like expounding of the Scripture, and that effectually alſo, as was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent in <hi>Cornelius,</hi> Acts 10. but the Sacraments cannot be ſo without the Word.</item>
                        <item>7. The Word is that which is confirmed by Signs annexed unto it; the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are thoſe Signs whereby it is confirmed.</item>
                        <item>8. The Word is to be preached unto thoſe onely who are of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, but the Sacrament of Baptiſm may be given unto In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; ſo was the Sacrament of Circumciſion, in whoſe room Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm ſucceeded: but the uncharitable Anabaptiſt will not ſtrike ſail to this Truth.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and the Word agree in theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Both exhibite the ſame things unto us, the ſame benefits, the ſame grace, the ſame Chriſt.</item>
                        <item>2. Both are from the Holy Ghoſt, and ſo both alſo confirm and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh Faith.</item>
                        <item>3. God inſtituteth both, God offereth both.</item>
                        <item>4. God accompliſheth both by the Miniſters of his Church; by whom he ſpeaketh with us in his word, and giveth thoſe Signs in his Sacraments.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the old and new Teſtament differ thus:
<list>
                        <item>1. In Rites, whereof change and alteration was made at Chriſts coming, that thereby might be ſignified the ceaſing of the Ceremonies of the Law, and the beginning or ſucceeding of the Goſpel.</item>
                        <item>2. In multitude and number; under the Law were more in number, and more laborious; now are fewer, and more eaſie Rites.</item>
                        <item>3. In ſignification; thoſe ſignified Chriſt to come, theſe Chriſt that was come.</item>

                        <item>4. In binding and obliging men; the Old bound onely <hi>Abrahams</hi> poſterity, ours binde the whole Church of all Nations and Countreys.</item>
                        <item>5. In continuance; the Old were to continue but until the coming of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> the New to the end of the world.</item>
                        <item>6. In clearneſs; they were more obſcure and dark, becauſe they ſignified things to be manifeſted; but theſe more clear and plain, becauſe they ſignifie things already manifeſted.</item>

                  <head>§. 2. <hi>Baptiſm.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>BAptiſm is a Sacrament inſtituted by Chriſt in the New Teſtament, whereby we are waſhed with water <hi>In the Name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to ſignifie that we are received into favor for the Blood of Chriſt ſhed for us; and alſo to binde us, that hereafter we endeavor in our actions and deeds truly to teſtifie newneſs of life. Baptiſm is neceſſary in part and reſpectively, ſo as it is a mark of the true Church, as it is a Seal of the Covenant, and as it ſerveth to enter and admit Infants into the viſible Church; but it is not abſolutely or ſimply neceſſary, ſo as the party that dyes without it, remains in the ſtate of damnation, and cannot be ſaved: for the Seal of the Covenant differeth from the Covenant it ſelf, to which this Seal is but annexed and depending upon. Indeed the Covenant of Grace, and our being in Chriſt, is abſolutely neceſſary; but the bare want of Baptiſm (when it cannot be had) or privation of it in this caſe is pardonable, and doth not condemn the party unbaptized: The thief upon the Croſs was ſaved, though he were never Baptized, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p>Infants born of believing Parents, are holy before Baptiſm, and Baptiſm is a Seal of that holineſs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.14. The children of believing Parents are holy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. therefore the children of the faithful are not to be denyed this Baptiſm, becauſe God hath promiſed in the perſon of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he will be the God of the faithful, and of their ſeed; as alſo for other reaſons ſet down in the Scripture: For ſeeing Infants belong as well unto the Covenant and Church of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. as they who are of full age; and ſeeing alſo unto them is promiſed Remiſſion of ſins by the blood of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.14. and the Holy Ghoſt the worker of Faith, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.14, 15. as well as unto thoſe of full growth, they are by Baptiſm to be ingrafted into the Church of God, and to be diſcerned from the children of Infidels, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.47. as in the Old Teſtament was done by Circumciſion, in whoſe place Baptiſm ſucceeded in the New, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12, 13. And though Infants have not indeed an actual faith, yet they have an inclination to believe, which the Holy Ghoſt, as is fitteſt for their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity and condition, worketh in them: So that we muſt judge of the Infants of the faithful according to charity, who have intereſt in the outward Covenant, until by infidelity when they come to years of diſcretion, they ſhall cut off themſelves; grounding our ſelves upon the Promiſe of God made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 17.7. yea, the reſolution of <hi>Beza</hi> in his Tenth Epiſtle is, That the children of Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated perſons may be Baptized: And though (to be Baptized) actual faith be required in thoſe of underſtanding, yet in Infants born in the Church, is required an inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion onely to this actual faith, which they have after their maner potentially, though not actually; and to be born in the Church of believing Parents, is unto Infants in ſtead of profeſſion of Faith and Repentance.</p>
                  <p>Hence may it appear how far from this Sacrament of Baptiſm the Anabaptiſts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate, by making it but an idle Ceremony; acknowledging indeed ſome of the ends and uſes thereof, but reſtraining the efficacy thereof, and ſo take away the chiefeſt comfort and trueſt benefit the Church reaps thereby. Many indeed are Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized, which receive not the Graces propounded and offered therein, but the fault is not in that no Grace accompanieth that Sacrament, but in that they receive it not, but afterwards when they come to years of diſcretion, they reject the Grace which appertaineth thereto: What if ſome believe not, ſhall their unbelief make the faith of God without effect? God forbid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.3. and Baptiſm is no natural means of working Grace, as if the Grace which is ſealed up thereby, were inherent in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or in the Miniſters act of ſprinkling it, but it is onely a voluntary inſtrument which Chriſt uſeth, as it pleaſeth him, to work what Grace or meaſure of Grace ſeemeth beſt to him; ſo as Grace is onely aſſiſtant to it, not included in it: yet in the right uſe thereof Chriſt by his Spirit worketh that Grace which is received by

So that unto true Baptiſm muſt concur a death unto ſin in him that is Baptized, and a new birth unto righteouſneſs, otherwiſe his Baptiſm is vain; for it is not the waſhing away of the filth of the fleſh, but the ſtipulation of a good Conſcience, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. The uſe of this Sacrament without faith doth not ſave, therefore with faith it doth ſave; the want of this Sacrament doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn, yet ſo as that want be without contempt; ſo ſome may be ſaved which are not Baptized, but none can be ſaved which do not believe: For the bare water in Baptiſm is not ſufficient unto Salvation, neither is it changed into the very Blood of Chriſt, neither is the Blood of Chriſt preſent in the water, or in the ſame place with the water, neither are their bodies who are Baptized, waſhed therewith viſibly; neither is the Holy Ghoſt by his vertue more in this water then elſwhere, but in the right uſe of Baptiſm he worketh in the hearts of them who are Baptized and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually ſprinkled, and waſheth them with the Blood of Chriſt, and uſeth this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Symbole or Sign as an inſtrument, and as a viſible word or promiſe to ſtay and ſtir up the faith of them who are Baptized.</p>
                  <p>Now all they, and they alone receive Baptiſm to the right uſe, who are renewed, or renewing and are Baptized to thoſe ends whereto Baptiſm was by Chriſt inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted. And as the Covenant once made with God, is alſo afterwards, after ſins committed, perpetually firm and of force to the Repentant: So alſo Baptiſm being once received, confirmeth and aſſureth the Repentant all their life time of remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins, and therefore it ought not to be reiterated nor deferred; neither yet are all thoſe who are Baptized with water, whether they be of underſtanding or Infants, partakers of the Grace of Chriſt, for the everlaſting Election of God, and his Calling into the Kingdom of Chriſt, is free. And as for the wickedneſs of the Miniſter Baptizing, it makes not the Baptiſm void, or of no effect and force unto them ſo Baptized, ſo that it be adminiſtred into the Promiſe and Faith of Chriſt; and therefore alſo the true Church doth not Baptize them who have been Baptized of Hereticks, but onely muſt inform and inſtruct them with true Doctrine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt and Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, touching the uſe of Godfathers and Godmothers, it is not at all neceſſary, nor by God required to the Sacrament of Baptiſm; for Chriſt hath not in any of his Inſtitutions ſo much as intimated the uſe of ſuch Sureties; and the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation are witneſſes of the childes admiſſion into the Church, the Parents being bound to perform what is required for the childes education.</p>

                        <item>1. That it ſhould be a mark whereby the Church may be diſcerned from all other Nations and Sects, which is as it were gathered by the Word and Baptiſm.</item>
                        <item>2. To be a confirmation of our faith, that is, a teſtification that Chriſt waſheth us with his blood, that he beſtoweth on us Remiſſion of ſins, Juſtification and Regeneration; or, To be the ſealing of God, and alſo the ſealing or obſignation of the Promiſe of Grace, and a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:97622:36"/>teſtimony of Gods will, that he giveth us theſe gifts at this preſent, and will give them ever henceforward.</item>
                        <item>3. To be a teſtification of our duty towards God, and a binding of us and the Church to the knowledge and worſhip of God, into whoſe Name we are Baptized, we binde our ſelves in Baptiſm to thankfulneſs; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to Faith, that is, to receive the promiſed benefits with faith, and then withal unto repentance and amendment of life.</item>
                        <item>4. To be a ſignification or an advertiſement unto us of the Croſs, and of the preſervation of the Church therein, and deliverance thereof from it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.22. In regard whereof Baptiſm is compared unto the flood; for as in that general Deluge ſome were ſhut into the Ark, the reſt of mankinde periſhing; ſo in the Church, they who cleave unto Chriſt, although they be preſſed with calamities, yet at length in their appointed time they are delivered.</item>
                        <item>5. To ſignifie the unity of the Church; for Baptiſm is a binding of the members of the Church among themſelves to mutual love, becauſe when it ſevereth and diſtinguiſheth the members of the Church from others, it doth alſo joyn and unite them among themſelves.</item>
                        <item>6. To be a Token and Symbole of our receiving and entrance into the Church: Hither appertain all thoſe places in Scripture, in which thoſe who were become Chriſtians, are ſaid to have been preſently Baptized.</item>
                        <item>7. To be a means of preſerving and propagating the Doctrine of the free Promiſe through the death of Chriſt; that the Baptized may have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to teach and learn who is the Author, and what is the meaning or ſignification of Baptiſm.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Type of Baptiſm was <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark born up by the waters, wherein the Church which then was in <hi>Noahs</hi> family, was ſaved, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. And though Baptiſm be a mark of the true Church, yet may not the Papiſts thereby challenge theirs to be the true Church; for Baptiſm ſevered from the true preaching of the Word, is no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient note of a true Church: for the Iſraelites had circumciſion, and yet the Lord ſaith, they were not his people, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1.9. Again, they overturn the inward power of Baptiſm, by denying Juſtification by Faith alone in Jeſus Chriſt. And as for the baſtard-Rites and Ceremonies invented and patched by men to Baptiſm, as hallowing of the Water, Tapers, Exorciſms, Chriſm, Salt, Croſſes, Spittle, and ſuch like, they are not of the true Church, but a corruption of the Sacrament: And as theſe men attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute too much to this Sacrament, holding that it gives Grace <hi>ex opere operato;</hi> ſo on the other ſide, there are other giddy heads, who number Baptiſm among things in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and ſo to be uſed or refuſed at our diſcretion. Laſtly, ſeeing the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments is a part of Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline, or rather Doctrine indeed, they that are not called thereto, and eſpecially women, may not in any caſe uſurp the power and authority to Baptize.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THe Lords Supper is a Sacrament inſtituted and appointed of Chriſt unto the faithful for a memorial of him, whereby Chriſt doth certainly promiſe and ſeal unto the faithful, That his Body was offered and broken on the Croſs, and his Blood ſhed for them, as truly as they ſee his Bread broken, and Cup diſtributed to them; and that he doth as certainly with his Body crucified and his Blood ſhed, feed and nouriſh the Souls of the faithful unto everlaſting life, as certainly as their bodies are fed with the bread, and the cup of the Lord is received from the hand of the Miniſter, which are offered to them as certain Seals of the body and blood of Chriſt, and binde them to mutual dilection and love. The Evangeliſts ſhew it was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted of Chriſt the ſame night he was betrayed, after that he had ſupped, and had eaten the <hi>Eaſter</hi>-Lamb according to the Law; yet is it ſo called, not ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the night wherein Chriſt was betrayed, as to ſhew that it is indeed a Spiritual Supper given of God unto the faithful: It is indeed the Sacrament of our Redemption by Chriſts death; inſomuch as to ſuch as worthily and with faith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſame, the bread which is broken, is a partaking of the body of Chriſt, and likewiſe the cup of bleſſing, is a partaking of his blood: Such therefore as declare themſelves in confeſſion and life to be Infidels and ungodly, are not to be admitted to this Supper, leſt thereby the Covenant of God be prophaned, and the wrath of God ſtirred up againſt the whole Aſſembly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20. Wherefore the Church by the commandment of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, uſing the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, ought to drive them from this Supper, till they ſhall repent, and change their life and converſation.</p>

                        <item>3. As the wine is ſevered from the bread to ſignifie the violence of Chriſts death; ſo his blood was ſundred from his body, ſignified alſo by the breaking of the bread; and as the bread is eaten being broken, ſo the body of Chriſt is received being ſacrificed.</item>

                        <item>1. A right preparation, which chiefly conſiſts in knowledge, prayer, ſelf-examination, contrition and repentance, faith, a reſolution againſt ſin for the future, and charity; for this Sacrament is a Communion where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all the receivers joyntly united by love, do participate of one and the ſame Chriſt.</item>
                        <item>2. A right receiving; wherein is ſpecially required the renewing of our knowledge or general faith, which is renewed principally by meditation in the uſe of the Supper, and the renewing of our ſpecial faith in Chriſt.</item>
                        <item>3. A right uſe of it afterward, when we muſt give God thanks for ſo great a benefit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.26. and look to receive by it encreaſe of faith and repentance, to riſe from ſin, and to receive power againſt the Devil.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>We may examine our Faith by theſe marks
<list>
                        <item>1. Whether we can from our hearts renounce our falſe ſuppoſed good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and can wholly relye upon Chriſt in the matter of our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for this Nature cannot do.</item>
                        <item>2. Whether we have peace of conſcience ariſing from the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Gods love in Chriſt, and our reconciliation with him.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>Again, our Faith which is the wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding garment, may be examined by theſe particulars; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Whether we believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the <hi>Meſſias</hi> and Savior of the world.</item>
                        <item>2. That he was crucified, and ſhed his blood.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>In the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our faith, we muſt alſo enquire
<list>
                        <item>1. Whether we have onely a general Faith, an hiſtorical temporal Faith, or a legal Faith; none of which alone doth ſave.</item>
                        <item>2. Whether we have an Evangelical Faith in the Promiſes of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, approving to our own hearts on true and ſound ground that they belong to us in particular, and ſo a Juſtifying Faith; without which we may not dare approach the Lords Table.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>So alſo we muſt examine whether we have theſe five things required in Faith; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. A true underſtanding and knowledge of God and his will in his Word.</item>
                        <item>2. A true conſent and aſſent in the heart, that it is Gods word, and all of it moſt true.</item>
                        <item>3. A profeſſion and approbation of it.</item>
                        <item>4. An application of Chriſt upon a ſound ground to be thy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior in particular.</item>
                        <item>5. A continual declaration of our faith, by the diligent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice of good works.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, we muſt examine whether we are not given too much to preſumption or deſperation; either of which are main lets and hindrances unto Faith: Then we muſt try our Faith by the marks of it:

                  </p>
                  <p>We may know whether we have Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or not, by enquiring of our own hearts

                        <item>2. Whether there be in us a changing of the minde, and a purpoſe to forſake ſin, and ever after to pleaſe God.</item>
                        <item>3. Whether we do daily break off our ſins, and abſtain from inward practice, keeping under our corruptions and ungodly thoughts.</item>
                        <item>4. Whether we mourn for the preſent corruption of our nature.</item>
                        <item>5. Whether we have been grieved, and craved pardon for our late ſins, even ſince we were laſt partakers of the Lords Table.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>In Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance we muſt examine
<list>
                        <item>1. Whether it be from the heart, in truth and uprightneſs, or onely in hypocriſie.</item>
                        <item>2. Whether it be from the whole heart, or whether we uſe not double-dealing with God.</item>
                        <item>3. Whether we return from all our ſins, or onely from ſome, living ſtill in our ſins.</item>
                        <item>4. Whether we repent (as we ſin) every day or no; or onely for a fit, and return to our ſins again.</item>
                        <item>5. Whether we behave our ſelves uprightly both before God and men, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely and privately; or whether we do not rather ſeem better then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we are, and ſo commit horrible and ſhameful ſins in ſecret.</item>

                        <item>2. Whether we are truly humbled inwardly and outwardly for them.</item>
                        <item>3. Whether we have a godly ſorrow for them, which bringeth forth a circumſpect care, a clearing of our ſelves, juſt indignation, filial fear, earneſt deſire, fervent zeal, and a holy revenge.</item>
                        <item>4. Whether we do often call to God for mercy and pardon in Chriſts Name.</item>
                        <item>5. Whether we have fully purpoſed and reſolved to amend our lives, and turn unto God with the whole man: And this reſolution muſt be forthwith put in practice, and continued to our lives end, for otherwiſe we but mock God, and deceive our own ſouls.</item>

                        <item>4. If there follow a change in the life. The companions of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are a broken and a contrite Spirit, a bitter ſoul, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a weeping eye; but the infallible Rule to examine our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and to know whether it be true or falſe, is by obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſubſequent courſe of our life.</item>

That then the wicked and hypocrites (as well as the godly) coming to the Supper, ſhould then receive Chriſt, and be indeed partakers of the body and blood of Chriſt, yea irrational creatures, which is hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Blaſphemy to imagine and determine.</item>

<list>
                        <item>1. The Supper of the Lord teſtifies to us that we have perfect for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of all our ſins for that onely Sacrifice of Chriſt, which himſelf once fully wrought on the croſs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27. But in the Maſs it is denyed that the quick and the dead have remiſſion of ſins for the onely Paſſion of Chriſt, except alſo Chriſt be daily offered for them by their Sacrificers.</item>
                        <item>2. The Supper of the Lord teſtifies alſo that we by the Holy Ghoſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:97622:42"/>are grafted into Chriſt, who now according to his humane Nature is onely in heaven at the right hand of his Father, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. and there will be worſhipped of us, <hi>John</hi> 4.21, 22, 23. But the Maſs teacheth that Chriſt is bodily under the forms of bread and wine, and therefore (ſay they) is to be worſhipped in them: So that the very foundation of the Maſs is nothing elſe then an utter denyal of that onely Sacrifice and Paſſion of Chriſt Jeſus, and an accurſed Idolatry.</item>
                        <item>3. The Popiſh Maſs changeth, or rather aboliſhed the Rite inſtituted by Chriſt, for it taketh away the cup from the people, and moſt preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuouſly addeth many toys.</item>
                        <item>4. The Maſs transformeth the Sign into the thing ſignified, for it denyeth that there is any bread or wine remaining.</item>
                        <item>5. In the Maſs the Papiſts make other gifts to be, then which are found in the Word and Sacrament, or in the Promiſe annexed unto them; as Merit even by the work it ſelf wrought, Remiſſion of ſins for the dead, and healing of Men, Oxen, Swine and Cattel diſeaſed.</item>
                        <item>6. The Maſs is repugnant to Chriſts Prieſthood; becauſe he is onely the High Prieſt who hath power to offer himſelf: yet his Unholineſs the Pope, with his companions, moſt impudently pulleth this honor to himſelf.</item>
                        <item>7. The Maſs is repugnant to the Doctrine of Grace and Juſtification, which teacheth, That in this life onely is the time of obtaining favor by faith alone, for the onely Merit of Chriſt; but the Papiſts neglecting faith, and rejecting Chriſts Merit, have ſubſtituted in place thereof this Idolatrous Maſs.</item>
                        <item>8. The Maſs moſt ridiculouſly imagineth that Chriſts body doth deſcend into our bodies, and there remaineth ſo long as the forms of bread and wine remain; but the Supper teacheth us, That we are made members of Chriſt by the Holy Ghoſt, and ingrafted into him.</item>

Again, they who eat Chriſt in the Lords Supper, as the Fathers before his Incarnation, did eat him in Manna and the Paſchal Lamb, cannot be ſaid to eat Chriſt corporally, for at that time he was not born; now all the faithful eat Chriſt in the Lords Supper, as the Fathers before his Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did eat him in Manna and the Paſchal Lamb, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 20.3, 4. therefore the faithful can no way be ſaid to eat Chriſt corporally: yet we hold, that the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the Supper do truly receive and eat, but by the Spirit and by Faith, the very true Body of Chriſt the which was crucified for us, and ſo far forth as it was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered up for us; and that they drink his Blood which was ſhed for us for the Remiſſion of ſins, and that indeed the Body is preſent and the Blood is preſent, but unto the Spirit and unto the inward man: for unto the Spirit, all things which he receiveth by faith, are in truth preſent according to that, That Chriſt dwelleth in our hearts by faith: And no diſtance of place can effect, that the things we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:97622:43"/>by faith ſhould be abſent from us; even as the Sun cannot properly be ſaid to be abſent from the eyes of which it is perceived.</p>

                  <head>§. 1. <hi>Prayer.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>TRue Prayer may briefly be decribed to be that which is poured out from the heart (the Holy Ghoſt ſtirring it) unto God, with this confidence upon the true perſwaſion of Gods love towards us, That we ſhall be heard for Chriſt the Mediators ſake: And it hath the chief place among Good Works, yielding us the greateſt teſtimony of our Salvation, by enabling us to perform other good Duties. Or thus; Prayer is a Petition joyned with an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and earneſt deſire, whether uttered in words or not uttered, whereby we ask of the true God revealed in his Word, thoſe things which he hath commanded to be asked of him; proceeding from an acknowledgement of our neceſſity and miſery, with humility, repentance, and confeſſion of our own unworthineſs, made in true converſion unto God, and in a confidence and ſure truſt in Gods Promiſes, for Chriſts ſake our Mediator.</p>
                  <p>For the right underſtanding of which Promiſes, this Rule muſt be remembred, That the Promiſes of God are not made directly to the work of Prayer, but to the perſon that prayeth; and yet not to him ſimply, as he doth this good action of Prayer, but as he is in Chriſt, for whoſe Merits ſake the Promiſe is accompliſhed: whereby it is moſt evident, That our Prayer is not the cauſe of the bleſſings we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from God, but onely a way and inſtrument in and by which God conveyeth his bleſſings unto his children, in whom is required in Prayer a ſpecial particular faith to apply to themſelves the Promiſe of God concerning that thing which they ask in Prayer; which ſpecial faith we can never bring with us in Prayer, unleſs we have a ſpecial ſaving faith, whereby we believe our reconciliation with God in Chriſt. So that the unfained deſire of a touched heart, is a Prayer in acceptance before God, though knowledge, memory and utterance to frame and conceive a form of Prayer in words be wanting, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.17. for Prayer is not a work of the memory, or a work of the wit, but the work of a ſanctified heart, it is the work of Gods Spirit; the very eſſence whereof conſiſteth in making known the inward deſires, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.8. always in the mediation of Chriſt, by reaſon of the infinite Majeſty of God, and ſinfulneſs of the creature, with awful fear and inward reverence, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted with ſeemly words (if it be oral Prayer) befitting our matter, not over-curious, nor careleſs, with reverent, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.2, 6. and humble geſture, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.5, 6. to expreſs which, kneeling is moſt proper; <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth it, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.30. if we cannot conveniently kneel, then ſtand; ſo did the poor humble Publican when he prayed,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:97622:43"/>
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 18.13. other geſtures when no neceſſity requireth, argue little reverence, leſs humility: we muſt alſo come in aſſurance of faith to be heard and accepted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.6. which is ſtrengthned by meditation on the Promiſes concerning ſuch things as we pray for, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.27, 28. which full aſſurance, as a luſty gale of wind, carrieth our Prayers with full fail to heaven, the deſired Haven; wavering and doubting, like oppoſite uncertain winds, carry them to ſome other place, and ſo they return with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeeding.</p>
                  <p>The ſupplicant muſt alſo be lowly in minde, and holy in life, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.15. the blinde man knew God heard not impenitents, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.31. he muſt have a true underſtanding, ſenſe, and earneſt deſire of what he prays for in ſincerity of heart, and fervency of ſpirit, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. for Prayer aſcends no higher then faith and fervor of Spirit carry it: Yet notwithſtanding which earneſtneſs and fervency in Prayer, it may be no true Prayer, as the wicked mans prayer made in his extremity, which is termed but <hi>howling, Hoſea</hi> 7.14. So a thief is earneſt with a Judge to ſpare him, but this is but carnal earneſtneſs.</p>
                  <p>Thus God takes our prayers by weight, not by number, not by labor, not by earneſtneſs, which is a thing that may come from the fleſh, but if it come from his Spirit, he accepts it, and then though we may have a ſecret anſwer to our prayers, yet may we wait long before the thing it ſelf be given us, but then God continues a ſecret ſtrength to us, that we may wait and hold out; yea, though we never have any requeſt in this world granted, yet we muſt think this ſufficient, that we can and do pray unto God; for by whoſe Grace have we alway continued in prayer, but by the gift and Grace of God? God indeed anſwers ſome ſooner, ſome later, ſome he anſwers quickly, and ſome he defers longer; but importunity will prevail with him, ſo as thou ſhalt have Chriſt, and after thou haſt him, thou muſt look to the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges thou haſt by him; onely remembring as the priviledges thou haſt by him, ſo the condition of after-obedience: For Prayer is the means which God hath ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to unlock the cloſet of his Graces; and he being the Fountain of all Bleſſings, if we uſe not Prayer aright, it may be truly ſaid to us, as the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> ſpoke, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Thou haſt nothing to draw with, and the well is deep, from whence therefore canſt thou have that living water?</hi> yea, what the Lord did miraculouſly to <hi>Stephen,</hi> when he opened the heavens, and ſhewed himſelf to the outward view, that he doth ordinarily to the Saints in prayer, he ſhews himſelf to their mindes and inward affections.</p>
                  <p>Touching the time of Prayer, if it be the ſecret and lifting up of the heart to God (called Ejaculation) then pray continually, pray without ceaſing, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. but if it be a ſet and ſolemn prayer, either in private or in the Congregation, the Word of God appoints no preciſe hour for this kinde, becauſe now there is no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween time and time, in regard of Conſcience, for performing the worſhip of God and the duties of Religion, the Lords-day onely excepted. In the New Teſtament the diſtinction of days and hours is taken away; <hi>Paul</hi> was afraid of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> becauſe they made difference of days, times, moneths and years, in reſpect of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Religion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. And as touching the place of Prayer in regard of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, Holineſs and Religion, all places are equal and alike in the New Teſtament, ſince the coming of Chriſt; the houſe or field is holy as the Church, and if we pray in either of them as we ought, our prayer is as acceptable to God, as that which is made in the Church: for now the days are come foretold by the Prophet, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.11. which <hi>Paul</hi> expounds, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. yet nevertheleſs, for order, decency and quietneſs ſake, publike prayer is to be made in publike places, as Churches and Chappels appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that uſe. But undenyable it is, that all places are alike in reſpect of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and of his hearing, for he is Omnipreſent, whereſoever a man hath occaſion to pray, there God is; which concerns them to conſider, who make the Church a more holy place for prayer then other-where, and therefore reſerve all or moſt of their prayers till they come thither, forgetting that whereſover two or three of the faithful are gathered together, there God is in the midſt of them: for now difference
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:97622:44"/>of place in reſpect of Gods preſence is taken away: God is as well in the field and in the private houſe, as in the Church: and yet Churches are ordained and uſed in a godly policy, becauſe a Congregation may more conveniently there meet to their mutual edification, in the publike exerciſe of the Word and Prayer; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe private houſes were as good places for Gods worſhip as Churches, if they were decent and convenient for edification, for now in all places men may lift up pure hands unto God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. where it plainly appears, That after the coming of Chriſt (by whom the partition wall was broken down, and both made one people to God) all places were ſanctified for prayer, ſo as under the Goſpel no one place is more holy then another; yet it being Gods will to be worſhipped publikely, needful it is that there ſhould be places fit for that purpoſe. Thus the <hi>Corinthians</hi> had one place to worſhip God in, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20. though certain of the Inhabitants of <hi>Philippi</hi> went out to a Rivers ſide to pray on the Sabbath day, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.13. but that was in time of perſecution.</p>
                  <p>The Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt is to be prayed unto; we may pray unto the whole Trinity, but more properly unto the firſt perſon, God the Father, in the Name of God the Son, by the aſſiſtance of God the Holy Ghoſt: So we pray unto the whole Trinity, yet as the firſt perſon is the Fountain of the Deity, we pray the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Son through the Holy Ghoſt; nor is it ſtrange that we pray unto Chriſt, for whoſe ſake onely we are heard in our prayers, for we pray unto him as he is the ſecond perſon; we have our prayers heard through him as he is our Mediator, thus diſtinguiſhing his perſon from his office.</p>
                  <p>Prayer in general is twofold:
<list>
                        <item>1. Publike, wherein words muſt be always uſed in a plain, known, diſtinct voyce.</item>
                        <item>2. Private, wherein the voyce is profitable, but not ſimply neceſſary.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Two Rules of geſture in publike Prayer:
<list>
                        <item>1. It muſt alway be comely, modeſt, decent and uniform.</item>
                        <item>2. It muſt ſerve as much as may be to expreſs the inward ſincerity of the heart without hypocriſie.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, there is a twofold Prayer:
<list>
                        <item>1. One that is the voyce of our own ſpirit.</item>
                        <item>2. Another that is the voyce of Gods Spirit in us; that is, when the Holy Ghoſt hath ſo ſanctified the heart, when he hath put it into ſuch a holy frame of Grace, that the heart comes to ſpeak as it is quickned, acted and moved from Gods Spirit.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Spirit of Adoption makes us
<list>
                        <item>1. Earneſt and fervent in prayer.</item>
                        <item>2. Bold and confident (to God as to a Father) ſo that we may know the voyce of Gods Spirit in our prayers, by our boldneſs to, and confidence in him; for wicked men come to God as to a ſtranger, the Saints as to a friend.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prayer is one part of that holy wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Invocation, whereof there are four parts:
<list>
                        <item>1. Supplication, when we intreat God to remove ſome evil from us.</item>
                        <item>2. Prayer, whereby we beg at the hands of God the gift of ſome good thing unto us.</item>
                        <item>3. Interceſſion, when as we intreat the Lord to grant ſome good thing unto our brethren, or to remove ſome evil from them.</item>
                        <item>4. Thankſgiving, whereby we give laud and thanks to God for bleſſings received either by our ſelves or by our brethren.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Prayer in regard of the maner thereof; viz.
<list>
                        <item>1. Mental, which is an opening inwardly of the deſires of a mans heart to God, without any outward manifeſtation of the ſame by word, <hi>Neh.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.15. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.13.</item>
                        <item>2. Vocal, and is that which is uttered with words, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.23.</item>
                        <item>3. Sudden, when upon ſome ſudden occaſion preſent, the heart is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly lift up unto God, whether by ſighs or words; they are called
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:97622:44"/>Ejaculations of the heart, and argue a holy familiarity with God, yea a heavenly minde.</item>
                        <item>4. Compoſed, when a Chriſtian ſetteth himſelf to make ſome ſolemn prayer unto God, whether it be in the Church, family, cloſet, field, or any other place, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. to this kinde of Prayer, preparation before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand is very needful, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 5.2.</item>
                        <item>5. Conceived, being that which he who uttereth the prayer, inventeth and conceiveth himſelf; which is very expedient and needful, for theſe Reaſons:
<list>
                              <item>1. It manifeſteth the gift and power of the Spirit, who can give both matter and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, words and affections, who can ſuggeſt what to pray, and how to pray.</item>
                              <item>2. Every day we have new wants, new aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, new ſins, and our petitions muſt be made according to our preſent wants, our ſupplications according to our particular aſſaults, and our confeſſion according to our ſeveral ſins.</item>
                              <item>3. As God daily continueth and reneweth old bleſſings, ſo alſo he addeth new to them.</item>

                  <p>Rules to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that we may conceive aright of God in Prayer:
<list>
                        <item>1. We muſt not conceive him in the form of any earthly or heavenly, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily or Spiritual creature whatſoever; for thus not to conceive him, is a degree of conceiving him aright: We muſt not frame in our mindes any Image of God at all, as that he ſhould be like unto man, or any other creature; but we muſt conceive of him both in his works as our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, Governor and Preſerver, and alſo in his properties as moſt wiſe, moſt juſt, moſt holy, merciful, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus we may better conceive of him by his Works and Attributes, then by his Nature.</item>
                        <item>2. We muſt conceive that God is one in Subſtance, and three in Perſons: We muſt not confound the Perſons, nor divide the Subſtance, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of one God in three Perſons, and three Perſons in one and the ſame Godhead; ſo he muſt not be conceived abſolutely, that is, out of the Trinity, but as he ſubſiſteth in the Perſon of the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt.</item>
                        <item>3. When we direct our prayers or any worſhip to any one Perſon of the Trinity, we muſt include the reſt in the ſame worſhip; yea further, we muſt retain in minde the diſtinction and order of all the three Perſons, without ſevering or ſundring them.</item>

                  <head>§. 2. <hi>The Lords Prayer.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>VVE muſt imitate and follow the matter and form of the Lords Prayer in all our prayers, but are not ſo tyed to the very words of this Prayer, but that we may freely uſe them or other words at our pleaſure; for our Savior himſelf oft-times prayed in other words, and ſo did the Apoſtles; neither is there ſuch ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, as that by the bare repetition of them, we can binde God to grant our requeſts, or that we ſhould never pray in other words: But as the Ten Commandments con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all things to be done of us, the Creed all things to be believed by us, ſo the Lords Prayer doth comprehend all things to be asked by us of Almighty God.</p>
                  <p>Some think it is to be uſed onely as a Direction, by which we may learn how and what to pray, and that the words themſelves are not to be uſed; others think it the onely Prayer to be uſed at all times, and upon all occaſions: The former opinion grounds it ſelf on <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9. the latter on <hi>Luke</hi> 11.2. The truth is, the uſe of this Prayer is not onely to direct for matter, or for words, but for both; but in praying the very words, take heed leſt the tongue run without the heart, as it muſt needs do in thoſe that ceremoniouſly rehearſe them, making haſte to have done, before they ever truly began. Wherefore to pray theſe words rightly, he that prayeth muſt in ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient meaſure underſtand them, and have his minde taken up with them, in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, the heart ſtill conveying it ſelf into the meaning of every petition; and if thus this Prayer be ſaid, it is well uſed alone, or added to other prayer. Now we muſt know, That other prayers, though differing from this in order, yet if conſonant thereto in matter, may alſo be uſed by us; for otherwiſe <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles would not have uſed ſuch variety of order and maner in thankſgivings, requeſts and depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations for his Spiritual children, for himſelf, and for the whole Church: So that though this order be generally to be followed, yet neither is it always neceſſary, nor
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:97622:51"/>yet is it a ſwerving from this Direction, though ſome of theſe petitions onely be asked in ſome of our prayers, and others be omitted. But the error is, when we go beyond the Rules here given us, doting too much upon worldly things, or having proud, unfaithful or malicious hearts, we make our prayers the labor of pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted lips.</p>

                        <item>3. In the order thereof, which is moſt exquiſite.</item>
                        <item>4. In the acceptation it hath with God the Father; for it containeth the words of Chriſt his Son, in whom the Father is well pleaſed.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of this Prayer ſheweth,
<list>
                        <item>1. That if any ſet form of prayer may be uſed, then this may, being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited by the Mediator of the Church; therefore let ſuch as deny the uſe of it, better conſider hereof, when as for the ſpace of One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred years after Chriſt, there were never any that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allowed it.</item>
                        <item>2. That the practice of ſuch who conclude their prayers with this, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable; for hereby, as by a moſt perfect and excellent prayer, the wants and imperfections of our prayers are ſupplyed.</item>
                        <item>3. That ſuch who gather from the perfection and excellency of this prayer, that it alone is to be uſed, are deceived, for Chriſts intent was rather to commend this prayer unto us for matter and maner, then for the words.</item>
                        <item>4. That though it be a moſt perfect prayer, yet is it onely general; but every true Believer needs particular prayers, whereby in ſpecial form and maner his particular ſtate and condition may be ſent up unto the Lord; yet ſo, as they be always ſuitable unto this form here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed.</item>

                  <p>Two extremes are here to be taken heed of:
<list>

                  <p>Our Saviour Chriſt having forbidden his Diſciples all carnal and ſuperſtitious kinde of praying, preſcribed them this holy form, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.9, &amp;c. The uſe whereof is a form of Direction, learning thereby what to ask, what firſt and chiefly, with what
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:97622:52"/>affections and aſſurance; for if we were left unto our ſelves, we ſhould greatly erre in praying, asking oft-times thoſe things that are not good for us, and againſt the will of God, out of a fleſhly minde; therefore hath the Lord reduced all things, which we may ask, into theſe few ſhort Petitions, and out of any carnal preſumption to tranſgreſs theſe bounds, is not to offer a pleaſing Sacrifice, but as it were with ſtrange fire to provoke him, as did <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> Lev. 10.</p>

                              <item>3. In true contrition and ſorrow of heart for our own ſins, whereby we have offended God, who hath been ſo gracious and merciful a Father unto us in Chriſt.</item>
                              <item>4. In a ſound purpoſe of heart to break off the courſe of all ſin, and to walk before God in new obedience to all his Commandments.</item>

                     <list>
                        <item>1. We muſt apply to our ſelves all the Promiſes of God in Chriſt touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Righteouſneſs and life everlaſting; for he that makes them is our Father, therefore they belong to us that be his children.</item>
                        <item>2. This teacheth us when we pray, to be mindeful of Gods whole Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church and People.</item>
                        <item>3. Hence we learn how we muſt come affected towards our Brethren, when we pray to God, namely, lovingly and peaceably, as to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the ſame Father.</item>
                        <item>4. Here we ſee that all true Believers, whether high or low, poor or rich, are in equal condition in regard of God, for here Chriſt teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every one to ſay, <hi>Our Father.</hi>

                  <p>Hence it followeth, That wicked men living in ſin cannot pray, all their ſuppoſed praying is but a vain beating of the Air with a ſound of words; neither ſhall they ſpeed otherwiſe then <hi>Eſau</hi> did, though they cry aloud with ſtrong and bitter cryes; yet pray they ought, it being a common duty required of all men; but pray they cannot, yea they ſin if they pray, ſuch a maze or labyrinth doth ſin bring them into; but true Believers with confidence approach the Throne of Grace, and in an holy boldneſs ſay, <hi>Our Father.</hi>

                  <p>BY the Name of God, is meant the whole worſhip of God; or Gods Name is any thing that may be referred unto God, in which he may be conſidered; as his Word, his Sacraments, his Servants and his Works: So that by the Name of the Lord we are to underſtand That, whatſoever it is, whereby the Lord is made known unto us, according to his moſt glorious Attributes, as Wiſdom, Power, Juſtice, Mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and this may be either by his Titles, his Word or his Works. Now we muſt know, That Gods Name cannot be more ſanctified in it ſelf, then it is; but the ſanctifying of it that we here pray for, is, That it may be ſanctified in us, which may be when it heareth well by our walking worthy of this holy Name, which is amongſt us called upon and profeſſed; for contrariwiſe it is ſaid to be blaſphemed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.24. And whereas thy Name, O Lord, is uſed as unholy by prophane worldlings, vindicate and deliver it from ſuch abuſes, and make us to ſtand for thine honor againſt ſuch; and provide for the preſervation of the ſame, from being uſed as a common thing, working in all thy people an holy conſent to hallow it together, abſtaining from all common unworthy uſage thereof: And open our eyes, that we may know thee aright, and may diſcern thy Power, Wiſdom, Juſtice and Mercy, and enlarge our hearts, that we may ſanctifie thee in them, by making thee our Fear, Love, Joy and Confidence; and open our lips, that we may bleſs thee for thy goodneſs; yea, open our eyes, that we may ſee thee in thy Works, and ſtrike our hearts with reverence of thy Name appearing in them; and grant, that when we uſe any one of them, we may honor thee in our ſober and ſanctified uſe thereof.</p>
                  <p>This Petition comes in the firſt place, becauſe it is the end and ſcope of all the other, for the end of all things muſt be Gods glory; and it is placed before <hi>[Thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom come]</hi> to teach us, That no man can be a true Subject of Gods Kingdom, unleſs that in his heart he maketh principal account of Gods glory. Thus the firſt of the three firſt Petitions in the Lords Prayer concerning God immediately, concerns Gods glory it ſelf; The other two, the means whereby Gods glory is manifeſted and enlarged amongſt men: For Gods glory is then manifeſted, and his Name hallowed among men, when his Kingdom doth come, and his Will is done. And this order of the Petitions (that the firſt three concern Gods glory, the other three our ſelves) teacheth us how gracious the Lords is towards us ſinful men, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us if we come with one requeſt for the advancement of his glory, to come with another for our own benefit; if with three for him, with three for our ſelves alſo:

                        <item>2. We muſt propound the right end of our life every day in our Calling and Converſation; <hi>viz.</hi> Gods glory, and not our own praiſe, profit, pleaſure or honor.</item>
                        <item>3. When God offers occaſion by any work of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, we muſt endeavor to glorifie and magnifie his Name therein, whether they be acts of his Mercy or of his Juſtice.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>We muſt thus la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to hallow Gods Name, for theſe Reaſons:

                  <head>§. 6. <hi>Thy Kingdom come.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>GOds Kingdom is the Rule that he doth exerciſe over his Creatures; generally over all, the whole world, ſpecially over his Elect, over his Church, howſoever now diſperſed into many places, yet making but one Kingdom, which is partly in Heaven Triumphant, partly upon Earth Militant, till the laſt great Day, when in Heaven onely it ſhall be everlaſtingly glorious. Now beſides this, there is a Spiritual Kingdom, an inward Spiritual Kingdom of God, which is over all thoſe in whoſe hearts his Laws are written to do them, and the holy Spirit ruleth and beareth ſway; and happy is that man who is thus of his Kingdom. <hi>Let thy Kingdom come;</hi> that is, Let it by continual encreaſe be augmented, and always by a new enlargement and acceſſion be extended and multiplied, which thou, O Lord, in thy Church doſt hold and poſſeſs: wherein we deſire, That the number of true Believers may be daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, that Gods Kingdom of Grace may be enlarged, and his Kingdom of Glory haſtned. Thus let thy Kingdom come, outwardly thy Power and Providence being exerciſed, and inwardly Grace being encreaſed, and Glory haſtned. Let nothing hinder the coming of thy Kingdom, neither the Devil nor wicked men, neither in the Magiſtracy, Miniſtery nor People, neither infidelity, impenitency, any raigning ſin, or negligence; but let thy Kingdom come to us that be pilgrims and ſtrangers here on earth, prepare us for it, and enter us into it that be yet without; renew us by thy Spirit, that we may be ſubject to thy Will; confirm us alſo in this eſtate, that our ſouls after this life, and both ſouls and bodies at the Day of Judgement may be fully glorified; yea, Lord, haſten this glory to us, and to all thine Elect. And here alſo implicitely we acknowledge our oppoſite diſpoſition to Gods Kingdom, and bewail it: For this imports, That there is another Kingdom, even the Kingdom of Satan, which is a Kingdom of darkneſs, full of diſorder and confuſion through ſins, which greatly hindreth and annoyeth Gods Kingdom of Grace eſpecially: This is that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannical Regency, by which as the Prince of Darkneſs, he (by Gods juſt permiſſion) ruleth in the children of darkneſs, and rageth againſt the children of light, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.3. erecting up two other Kingdoms, the one of Sin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.12.5.21. the other of Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. all which are Enemies to this Kingdom we pray for.</p>
                  <p>This Petition doth in order next follow, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name,</hi> becauſe it is the firſt means by which Gods Name is hallowed; and next to the hallowing of his Name, we ought chieſly to pray, That Gods Kingdom may come, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.31. And it is alſo placed before <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> to teach us, That no man can rightly do the will of God and pleaſe him, unleſs he be of his Kingdom, and delivered out of the Kingdom of Darkneſs by faith in Chriſt, and the Spirit of Sanctification; he ſhall do his will indeed as a veſſel of wrath, being over-ruled by his Almighty power, but not as a veſſel of mercy, out of a good heart to be accepted. Thus no man can ever do Gods will in any thing, till ſuch time as Gods Kingdom be erected in his heart, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no man can do Gods will that is not Gods Subject, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.24. neither can any man keep Gods Law, but by Gods grace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.32. Conclude we therefore, That Gods Kingdom is that Spiritual Rule, which God through Chriſt doth by grace begin in us in this life, and by glory will accompliſh in the life to come, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.37. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.37.6.31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17.</p>

                  <p>THis Petition in order followeth <hi>Thy Kingdom come,</hi> to ſhew, That where Gods kingdom is ſet up, his will is endeavored after, and preferred always, and not our own will: It depends indeed on both the former Petitions, for Gods Name is hallowed when his will is done, and his kingdom comes, when by doing his will we teſtifie our ſelves his obedient Subjects. Wherein we deſire, that we and all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God upon earth may as readily obey Gods will, as the Angels and Saints in heaven: So that this Petition is propounded in a Compariſon, the former part whereof reſpects the grace of Obedience which we pray for, the other the right maner of performing it; wherein we muſt note, That this particle <hi>(As)</hi> doth not betoken the degree, but the kinde of doing Gods will, which is the beginning of performing Gods will with continuance and encreaſe thereof, not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation, perfection and full accompliſhment thereof, which yet we are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire here, that at length we may obtain it; which though it be impoſſible in this life, yet are we to pray for it as children raviſhed with the deſire of Gods glory. Thus, we pray not here to perform obedience equal in meaſure and degree of perfection, to the obedience of the bleſſed Angels and glorified Saints in heaven, but ſuch as is like unto it; for this note of Compariſon here imports a likeneſs and reſemblance, not equality, in doing the will of God chearfully, without murmuring; ſpeedily, without delaying; generally, without omitting; ſincerely, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling; conſtantly, without forbearing; and perfectly, without halting, even as the Saints and Angels in heaven. Now as many as truly be in Gods Kingdom, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but thus immediately do Gods will; for obedience to Gods will is an effectual ſign that the kingdom of God is in us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3. into which, <hi>not every one that ſaith, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter;</hi> but ſuch alone whoſe actions ſay, <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> Matth. 7.21.</p>

                        <item>2. His revealed will, being whatſoever is manifeſted in his word and works to be his will, concerning both faith and practice. This we are preciſely to follow, for here we pray that it may be anſwerably done as it is required. <hi>Thy will,</hi> that is, not my will; thy will onely, not thine and mine alſo, betwixt which two there is no proportion; thy will both for matter and maner; and thy will, though contrary unto, or againſt my will. <hi>As it is in Heaven;</hi> as by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of heaven, that are free from all temptations and diſcouragements.</item>

Now the ground of this work is the death of our Saviour Chriſt, applyed by true Faith to our corrupt hearts.</item>

Now in them we may obſerve theſe things for us to follow:
<list>
                        <item>1. They deſired before Chriſts Incarnation to look into the myſtery of our Redemption wrought by Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. much more doth it concern us to be diligent ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers out of this myſtery in the Goſpel.</item>
                        <item>2. The Angels are maintainers of true Religion, and of the worſhip of God, for the Law was given by Angels, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.19. they brought the Apoſtles out of priſon to preach the Goſpel, they are enemies to Idolatry, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10. Herein alſo let us be their followers.</item>
                        <item>3. The Angels were always nigh unto Chriſt at his Nativity, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.9, 10. in his temptation, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.11. in his Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.43. in his Reſurrection, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.2. and Aſcenſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.10. And ſo ſhould we perform unto Chriſt all the ſervice we can.</item>
                        <item>4. They are alway praiſing and lauding the Name of God; ſo ſhould we labor to have our hearts enlarged for his glory, and our mouthes filled with his praiſes.</item>
                        <item>5. They be ſerviceable for our good, if we be Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, though they be far better then we are, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. So muſt we imploy our ſelves in ſoul, body, calling, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and all we have, for the good of men.</item>
                        <item>6. They are joyful when ſinners are converted from ſin unto God, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.10. and are grieved when men by ſin diſhonor God; the like affections ſhould be in us: for in the world to come we ſhall be like the Angels in heaven in glory, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.30.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>This patern of Angelical obedience, here propounded for our imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt teach us,
<list>
                        <item>1. To acknowledge and bewail the natural hardneſs, deadneſs, and untowardneſs of our hearts in yielding obedience to the will of God.</item>
                        <item>2. To bewail the want of ſincerity and faithfulneſs in doing Gods will; our maimed and defective obedience ſhews how far we come ſhort of this Angelical example: Many content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the outward ſervice of the body, and never regard the inward worſhip of the heart; and others have reſpect to outward duties of piety, that concern God, but for upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mercy towards men, they little regard. This the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels do not.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Angelical example informs our judgement what honor we are to give to the bleſſed Angels, namely, the honor of imitation, and not of any divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: for when <hi>John</hi> would have worſhipped the Angel, he forbade him, ſaying, <hi>See thou do it not, worſhip God,</hi> Rev. 19.10. From all which let us be perſwaded to begin our heaven upon earth, by reſembling, though not equalling, the Angels
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:97622:62"/>in obedience; that ſo with them and all the Hoſt of Heaven we may ſincerely ſay, <hi>Thy will be done in Earth as it is in Heaven.</hi>

                     <l>Or with the words conclude the work, as though</l>
                     <l>The will of God were done by ſaying ſo.</l>

                     <l>Back from thy Will, and make our own a Law:</l>

                  <p>UNder the name of Bread, by that uſual figure <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> our Savior Chriſt compriſeth not onely all corporal bleſſings, and ſuch as are neceſſary for this life, but alſo the profitable uſe of them. <hi>Give us;</hi>] that is, Beſtow, bleſs and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie all temporal neceſſary good things unto us; Sanctifie all outward comforts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, which by reaſon of ſin ſtand accurſed, that they may not be a deſtruction to us in the uſe of them, as we deſerve: Beſtow, uphold, continue and maintain that which thou haſt given us; Bleſs, make proſperous and wholeſom our meats and drinks, for the ſtrengthning of our bodies, and refreſhing our Spirits, ſo as we may be enabled in the ſtrength of thy bleſſing, to ſerve thee in our Callings as thou haſt commanded. <hi>This day</hi>] that is, we deſire not ſuch abundance for ſo long a time, as whereby our dependance upon thee ſhould be cut off, but to be content with things neceſſary for the preſent, and to wait upon thee for the future from day to day. <hi>Daily bread</hi>] that is, Bread for our ſubſtance, ſuch as Nature doth require to uphold it; no dainties or coſtly feaſtings, but onely neceſſary food and cloathing, whereby the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of our bodies may be continued, and not pine away. <hi>Our daily bread</hi>] that is, not the bread, the clothes, the ſubſtance of another, but ſuch things honeſtly got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by our labor, through Gods bleſſing upon us, according to the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.2. And the wealthieſt in the world may not think himſelf too rich to beg this daily bread, for he knows not ere the day paſs, to what extremity, with <hi>Job,</hi> he may be brought.</p>
                  <p>This Petition followeth immediately <hi>Thy will be done,</hi> becauſe to have things neceſſary for our maintenance, is a ſtay and help unto us, the more chearfully to do the will of God, and keeps us from unlawful enterprizes; and becauſe the Rule of ſeeking things temporal muſt not be our own, but the will of God. So likewiſe this Petition in order is placed before this (<hi>Forgive us our Treſpaſſes</hi>) not for that the things of this life are to be ſought before thoſe that concern the life to come, for this is forbidden, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.27. but to provide againſt our infirmities, whereby we diſtruſt God for food, raiment, and worldly deliverances, when we profeſs that we believe in him for the remiſſion of ſin, and deliverance from damnation; and to provide for the ſtrengthning of our faith touching things eternal, by aſcending from theſe his gifts below, wherein we taſte of his goodneſs daily. By which order we are taught to conſider the corruption of mans Nature, which ought in the firſt place to ſeek things Spiritual; but becauſe we live rather by Senſe then by Faith, we do prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally deſire things corporal. Again, hereby appears Chriſts mercy unto man, in that by this order he deſcendeth to our infirmity, who rather depend on him for the pardon of our ſins, then truſt him for our proviſion in this life; which argues we are but of little faith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.5. Laſtly, by this order we are taught to depend upon
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:97622:62"/>him for the forgiveneſs of our ſins: for when we ſee that he is here ſo careful for our bodies, he will doubtleſs be more careful to provide for the good of our ſouls, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32.</p>

                        <item>4. To ſanctifie the Creatures by prayer and thankſgiving when we uſe them; for as we pray for them, ſo we ſhould glorifie God for his bleſſing upon them daily as we uſe them.</item>

                        <item>4. Like obedient children to ask of God our daily food, and to receive it as a gift of mercy from the hand of our Father. Away then with Merit by mans works, for if bread be of Mercy, Life everlaſting cannot be of Merit on mans part.</item>

                  <head>§. 9. <hi>And forgive us our Treſpaſſes, as we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>IN this Petition we pray, That God would freely forgive us all our ſins and treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes againſt his Laws, as we do from the heart forgive the offences by men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt us. The word <hi>Treſpaſſes</hi> in this Petition, is by <hi>Matthew</hi> called <hi>Debts,</hi> and by <hi>Luke, Sins;</hi> for ſins are debts, becauſe we owe obedience, of which we fail by ſin: and becauſe as by debt a man is in danger of impriſonment, ſo by ſin, of being caſt into the priſon of Hell, whence Chriſt hath ranſomed all Believers by paying the debt. Thus the word <hi>Debt</hi> is a figurative kinde of ſpeech, taken from bargaining, wherein God is reſembled to the Creditor; man is the Debtor, the Law is the Bond or Obligation, and Sin is that Debt of ours, for which we ſtand bound to God by the Law: which appears by this, That in the Evangeliſts the words <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Debt</hi> are uſed promiſcuouſly; as <hi>Luke</hi> 11.4. compared with <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.12. Now ſin makes us debtors unto God, not that we owe it him, for we are bound by the Law to the contrary obedience; but becauſe upon default of obedience unto God, whereto we are bound by the Law, we are bound for our ſins unto puniſhment, which is as it were a ſecond debt. Thus Chriſt calleth all our ſins <hi>Debts,</hi> Matth. 6. both Original and Actual, both of Fact and of Omiſſion, becauſe they make us debtors to God, either of obedience or puniſhment, which we are to pay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Forgive us</hi>] that is, Seeing we are not able to pay the debts occaſioned by our ſins, accept of the ſatisfaction made by the All-ſufficient Lord Jeſus, and for his ſake, Let not our debts be required at our hands, or any of them, for the leaſt of which we are never able to anſwer: So that this Forgiveneſs here asked, is a free and full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from ſin and the puniſhment thereof, without any ſatisfaction on our part; and this God doth, when he is content for Chriſts ſake not to impute ſin unto us, but to account it as not committed, and the puniſhment as not due unto us, being fully and freely contented with the All-ſufficient ſatisfaction made by Chriſt in his Death and Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi>] who are grievous ſinners, and are for ever forlorn without this mercy. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> that by faith do believe our ſins are pardoned, helping us againſt doubting, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming our faith. <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> who believe, continuing to us this thy grace unto the end, whereby we may daily have ſin expiated and done away, as by our weakneſs we are daily prone to ſin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Our Treſpaſſes</hi>] that is, The infinite ſins which proceed properly and naturally from us, as from a moſt corrupt fountain, and are no way to be imputed to thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty as the Author thereof, or to Fate or Conſtellation, or to the Devil onely, though he ſeeketh to bring us thereto; for every man is drawn away by his own concupiſcence, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As we forgive,</hi> &amp;c.] This is the condition upon which we deſire mercy at the Lords hands, which chiefly conſiſts in the reconciliation of the minde; for though we demand ſatisfaction where there is ability, yet remitting the malice, the Lord requireth no more at our hands, unleſs in the caſe of extreme poverty: ſo that a Treſpaſſer may be forgiven, and yet lawful ſatisfaction required; and a Debt may be forgiven, and yet the Condition here ſet down not performed; <hi>viz.</hi> if the minde be not reconciled, but continueth ſtill offended. Now though a treſpaſs be forgiven by man, yet may it be retained before God; and though not forgiven by man, yet may it be by God, upon the unfained humiliation and repentance of the Treſpaſſer. And although this forgiving of others is ſet as a condition required, that we may be forgiven, yet it is not for our forgiving of others, that God will forgive us; but this condition is put to teach us, That when we come to God in prayer, we ſhould not come in wrath, or hatred againſt other men, or with a deſire
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:97622:65"/>of revenge, for this is contrary to the good Spirit of Prayer. So then, we muſt here obſerve, That our forgiving of others, is not a cauſe of our forgiveneſs, but one effect of our Juſtification, and a token of the Image of God in us: For this condition imports, That we muſt exerciſe mercy towards our brethren, and ſo break off the courſe of our ſins, if we look for mercy at Gods hands; for the words in this Petition are comparative, betokening a likeneſs and ſimilitude between Gods forgiving and ours, which muſt be rightly underſtood, becauſe our forgiveneſs is mingled with much corruption through want of mercy; and therefore we muſt not underſtand it of the meaſure of forgiveneſs, nor yet of the maner ſimply, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the very act of forgiving: And the force of the Reaſon ſtands thus, If we who have but a drop of mercy forgive others, then do thou who art the Fountain of Mercy forgive us. Underſtand further, That a man forgives a treſpaſs onely as it is a damage unto man; but as it is a ſin againſt God in the tranſgreſſion of the Moral Law, ſo God onely pardons it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe words thus underſtood, muſt be conceived as a Reaſon drawn, not from the cauſe or like example, but from the ſign or pledge of Gods forgiveneſs; for God hath made a Promiſe to forgive us, if we forgive our brethren their treſpaſſes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25. Laſtly, the order of this Petition followeth, That wherein we crave the needful good things of this life, teaching that the main hindrance thereof is ſin, which till it be removed, hindreth that we cannot enjoy the good we deſire, nor be freed from the evil we decline; and that by having our daily bread, we ſhould lift up our mindes for Spiritual bleſſings unto God, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. and that it is nothing at all to have our daily bread, unleſs God give us alſo the pardon of our ſins.</p>

                        <item>1. Becauſe we owe love, which is thereby broken, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8.</item>
                        <item>2. Becauſe we owe puniſhment for doing wrong, <hi>Judg.</hi> 1.8.</item>
                        <item>3. Becauſe we owe ſatisfaction for the wrong done, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6.4.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe words (<hi>As we forgive our debtors</hi>) are added for theſe Reaſons:
<list>
                        <item>1. That we may rightly deſire remiſſion of ſins; that is, with faith and repentance, a ſign and token whereof is the love of our Neighbor.</item>
                        <item>2. That when we finde in our ſelves true faith and repentance, we may ſo have a certain argument and comfort in us, that we are of the number of them to whom remiſſion of ſins is promiſed, and that therefore we ſhall doubtleſs obtain the ſame.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>All offences that are done to us of others, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to theſe three Heads:

                        <item>1. Such as do onely diſpleaſe us, but bring no loſs or hurt to us.</item>
                        <item>2. Small injuries, ſuch as do not onely diſpleaſe us, but withal bring ſome little hurt to us, either in our life, goods or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name.</item>
                        <item>3. Greater injuries, ſuch as are not onely offenſive to our perſons, but withal do prejudice our life, and bring a ruine upon our eſtates, both in goods and good-name.</item>

                        <item>1. Of Revenge; that is, when we requite not evil for evil, either by thought, word or deed: This belongeth to all men.</item>
                        <item>2. Of private Puniſhments, when men return not puniſhments for injuries done, by way of requital; though we cannot forgive wholly and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly, yet we may truly and ſincerely.</item>
                        <item>3. Of Judgement, when we judge not an injury done to be an injury.</item>
                        <item>4. Of Satisfaction, when it is due for ſome hurt done: Now man is ſaid to forgive man, when he doth pardon either the wrong done, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.21. or the puniſhment appointed for the wrong, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.23. or the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction which the offender is bound to make, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.4. or all of them as occaſion is offered, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.32.</item>

                        <item>1. To inform us, that asking of pardon and teſtimony of Repentance go together; he that receives the one, muſt expreſs the other, for where God gives pardon, there alſo he gives grace to repent, and mercy is not granted but on condition of repentance, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37, 38.</item>
                        <item>2. To teach us to forgive our brethren, every day to renew our repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to humble our ſelves; and to let us know, That we are bound to forgive all perſons, <hi>Gol.</hi> 3.12. all ſins, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. and at all times, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.22. when men offend us; and that fully.</item>

                        <item>4. To admoniſh us to beware of the common ſin of this Age, which is, deſire of revenge, ſpite and grudging; for if we forgive not, we pray in effect that God would not forgive us, yea we curſe our ſelves.</item>
                        <item>5. To diſcover unto us the groſs hypocriſie of our Nature, for ſo oft as we make this Petition, we make profeſſion of reformation of life in new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; for this one branch of brotherly Reconciliation here profeſſed, doth preſuppoſe our Converſion from all ſin, ſince true Repentance for one ſin, cannot ſtand with a purpoſe to live in any other.</item>
                        <item>6. To ſtir us up to hunger after love, mercy, gentleneſs, meekneſs, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to practice the ſame continually; living in peace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.11. la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring to make peace, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.9. and ſhewing all tokens of love to our adverſaries, that they may aſſure themſelves we have wholly forgiven them.</item>
                        <item>7. To ſhew us the way how to keep true peace of conſcience for ever; for when we are at one with God and man, we have a bleſſed peace: and this is by calling upon God for the pardon of our ſins every day, and by following after peace with men in the practice of forgiveneſs and reconciliation, which is never ſincere without repentance.</item>
                        <item>8. To acquaint us, That no man living in malice can ſay the Lords Prayer as he ought to do, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.24. and that is a ſign of grace to forgive, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.32.</item>
                        <item>9. To exclude from pardon all ſuch as perſecute the Saints of God, till they repent, and practice as they pray in this Petition.</item>

                        <item>3. Not to lie down in the ſins we daily commit, but renew our eſtate by true humiliation and repentance; which conſiſts in daily examination, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, contrition, ſupplication and converſion.</item>

                        <item>5. That no man poſſibly can fulfil the Law, for the Apoſtles themſelves were commanded to ask pardon for ſin every day; whereby it is plain they could not fulfil the Law, much leſs can we.</item>
                        <item>6. In all godly maner to endeavor after what we pray for; for it is groſs alſo; hypocriſie daily to ask the pardon of ſin, and ſtill to continue in the daily practice thereof.</item>
                        <item>7. Not onely to pray for the pardon of our own ſins, but of our brethrens alſo; whereby we are taught, that the good eſtate of their ſouls ſhould be dear and precious to us.</item>

                        <item>2. Grace to acknowledge our ſins, for he that hides them ſhall not proſper, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. and all that know them do not confeſs them, or elſe ſome way juſtifie themſelves.</item>
                        <item>3. Grace to be truly humbled for ſin, and that in the ſenſe of Gods curſe due for it; elſe we are ſtill in our ſins, and cannot pray to ſpeed.</item>
                        <item>4. Juſtification through the death and blood-ſhedding of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.25. That Chriſts righteouſneſs may be made ours, and our ſins laid upon him, for his mercies ſake.</item>
                        <item>5. Love and charity towards our brethren; that God would give us a heart to be reconciled to them, pardoning their offences againſt us.</item>

                  <p>THis Petition in order is immediately ſubjoyned after the other, craving the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin, to teach us, That this is not the onely care of Chriſtians to ſeek to have ſins pardoned, but for the time to come earneſtly to ſtrive againſt and reſiſt it; the Chriſtian mans life being a continual warfare: So that there be two Petitions for the ſoul, but one for the body; teaching us, That our care for the eſtate Spiritual, ought to be double to our care for things Temporal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lead us not into Temptation, but,</hi> &amp;c.] that is, Suffer us not to be tempted above our power, or ſo that either we ſin, or wholly revolt from thee; but ſtrengthen us in our Temptations by thy holy Spirit, and deliver us from evil as the cauſe thereof: wherein we pray, That the Lord would not ſuffer us to be carried away by the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations of the World, the Fleſh, or the Devil, to the committing of ſin, but that he would deliver us from the evil of all Temptations, both of ſin and damnation. <hi>Lead us not into Temptation</hi> which we cannot bear; ſo <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> Redeem us
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:97622:67"/>from evil, that we be not carried by Temptations; ſo <hi>Calvin.</hi> And we pray thus, not that we may always be free, which cannot be, but that we may not be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, overcome, and made ſubject to Temptations, when we are by them aſſaulted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But deliver us from evil</hi>] that is, Withdraw not thy Grace from us, leave us not to our own luſts, neither deliver us over to Satan to be hardned, but in all aſſaults ſtand thou by us, that our faith may not fail, and deliver us from the evil both of ſin and puniſhment: So that the meaning hereof may be this, O Lord, we are every way ſubject to Temptations, and by our ſins we deſerve to be left therein to the malice of Satan, and to the power of our own Corruptions; yet we beſeech thee not to forſake us in any Temptation, but give an happy iſſue thereto, ſtill uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us by thy Grace. Now here we muſt obſerve, That God is ſaid to lead a man into Temptation, onely as Temptation is a puniſhment of ſin, and onely by permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, leaving the party to himſelf and Satans malice, for ſome former tranſgreſſion: For, God tempteth no man to deſtroy him, or to cauſe him to ſin, but to try and exerciſe his Graces in him; wherefore this Petition which Chriſt taught us, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not ſimply of all tryal and manifeſtation of our faith and godlineſs, unto which <hi>David</hi> offered himſelf of his own accord, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.

                  <p>The words themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain one onely Petition (though ſome have thought otherwiſe) conſiſting of two parts:
<list>
                        <item>1. The Petition it ſelf, <hi>Lead us not into Temptation;</hi> or a Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition of delivery from a particular future evil.</item>
                        <item>2. The Expoſition thereof, more general for delivery from all, as well preſent as future evil.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>There be two cauſes of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly two ſorts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
<list>
                        <item>1. From God, for the tryal of our faith, godlineſs, hope, patience, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, and obedience by the Croſs: So God is ſaid to have tempted <hi>Abraham, Joſeph, Job</hi> and <hi>David.</hi> This is good and holy, when as God tempts a man, which is an action of God, whereby he proveth and tryeth man, to make manifeſt unto man himſelf, and unto others, what is in his heart, for God knoweth well enough before he tryeth him. This is called Good, both in reſpect of the Author, which is God, and in reſpect of the end, which is the good of his ſervants: And this we here pray not againſt.</item>
                        <item>2. By the Devil, our Fleſh; and wicked men, which is every ſoliciting to ſin, which ſoliciting it ſelf is alſo ſin. This is evil, being a wicked motion, allurement, or perſwaſion, ariſing partly from our own corruption, and partly from the ſuggeſtion of the Devil, whereby man is provoked to ſin againſt God in the tranſgreſſion of ſome Commandment. Now by Nature man is prone to be tempted, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31. Sin is a deceitful tempter, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.13. and Satan is a ſubtile, cruel and diligent tempter, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. And this is that we pray againſt in this Petition.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are of divers ſorts; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Whereby God tryeth man, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.11. ſearching into his heart, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by affliction or otherwiſe, for Reaſons beſt known unto himſelf.</item>
                        <item>2. Whereby man tempteth God, as by murmuring and refuſing to believe, and to reſt on his Providence, without ſeeing evident preſent Signs of his goodneſs; ſeeking after new miracles, truſting in outward means, preſcribing God a time or maner of deliverance, impatient at his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, adventuring upon needleſs apparent dangers without warrant, or burthening the faithful with vain and needleſs Traditions.</item>
                        <item>3. Whereby man tempteth man, ſeeking to circumvent him, by trying him with politick devices. Thus the Phariſees are ſaid to have tempted Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.18.</item>
                        <item>4. Whereby man tempteth himſelf, his corrupt heart alluring and drawing him to ſin, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14.</item>
                        <pb n="109" facs="tcp:97622:67"/>
                        <item>5. Whereby the Devil tempteth man, and provoketh him to ſin: From theſe two laſt Temptations, of the Fleſh and the Devil, that is, corrupt and evil motions of the minde, we deſire here to be delivered; from the third we pray to be kept in the fourth Petition; from the ſecond in the ſecond Petition: From the firſt we pray not to be kept, but rather that the Lord would try us, and uſe all means he ſeeth beſt to further our Sanctification.</item>

                  <p>The four de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, by which it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth till it bring a man to deſtruction, unleſs it be cut off, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.14, 15.
<list>
                        <item>1. Suggeſtion; when the minde conceiveth a wicked thought, put in by Satan, or ariſing from natural corruption.</item>
                        <item>2. Delight; when the evil thought conceived, and for a time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the minde, deſcendeth to the heart, and there pleaſeth the will, and delighteth the affections.</item>
                        <item>3. Conſent; when the will yields to the evil motion, and the heart reſolves to practice it.</item>
                        <item>4. Perfection; when a Sin is often committed, and by cuſtom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes as it were ripe, whereupon follows deſtruction: Now a man is led into temptation, when he is left of God to an evil mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuggeſted into his minde, ſo as he gives conſent unto it, and goes on to the practice of it.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>To be led into Temptation, is to be poſſeſſed and held by the Temptation, after it hath aſſaulted us: For in every Temptation there be two actions; viz.
<list>
                        <item>1. One of God, whereby in his juſt Judgement he leaves a man to himſelf, or to the malice of Satan.</item>
                        <item>2. Another of man himſelf, whereby being left of God, he enters into the midſt of the Temptation, as it were plunging himſelf into it.</item>

When men have many good things in them, as knowledge in the myſtery of Salvation, beſide Moral vertues, then the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil labors that concupiſcence may ſtill raign in their hearts, by their living in ſome ſin or other, whereto they are naturally enclined.</item>

                        <item>4. When the Lord vouchſafeth to men the means of Salvation, then Satan labors to make the ſame void and of no effect, that ſo they may not onely miſs of Salvation, but be condemned the more deeply for the neglect and contempt of the means.</item>
                        <item>5. When he cannot work his will inwardly in their ſouls as he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, then he eſſays to do them miſchief by ſome outward Satanical operations. Thus he plagued <hi>Job.</hi>

                  <p>THis Concluſion is added as a Reaſon of all the Petitions, to ſtrengthen our Faith, that God being both able and willing, doth grant all our Requeſts made unto him in the Name of Chriſt, and therefore in the end we poſt-adde a note of Confidence, and ſay, <hi>Amen;</hi> which is originally an Hebrew word, yet uſed in all Languages: It ſignifieth Truth or Faith; the uttering of it after a Prayer, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth an Aſſent unto the Prayer, together with carneſtneſs of deſire, and Faith for the obtaining that which is prayed for. Thus the people were commanded to ſay, <hi>Amen,</hi> Deut. 27.15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and accordingly was it practiſed, <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.6.</p>

                  <p>Theſe words are a Reaſon of the former, touching which we muſt obſerve two things in general:

<list>
                        <item>1. From the Kingdom of God; a good King delights in the welfare of his Subjects, how much more doth the King of kings, who is Goodneſs it ſelf, in the happineſs of his? He will hear, defend and preſerve his Subjects.</item>
                        <item>2. From the Power of God, being mightier then all our Enemies, which joyned with his Soveraignty and Goodneſs, we need not fear though we were in the paws of Lyons, or the mouth of the Grave.</item>
                        <item>3. From his Glory, which is the end or final cauſe of our Requeſts, for we deſire theſe things for his glory, therefore will he grant whatſoever in our prayers may redound to his honor and glory.</item>

                        <item>2. That he hath an abſolute Soveraign Right, Title and Intereſt, to and in all things in heaven and earth.</item>
                        <item>3. That he hath Soveraign Rule and Authority over all things in heaven and earth; yea, over Hell it ſelf, and all the powers and principalities thereof, governing all things whatſoever as he pleaſeth, and bringing them into an abſolute ſubjection.</item>

                        <item>2. To diſtinguiſh God from earthly Kings; for though they have a Kingdom, Power and Glory, yet they have all theſe from God, not of themſelves, and onely for a certain limited time; but God hath them all of himſelf alone, not from any other, and that for ever and ever.</item>

<list>
                        <item>1.

                        <item>2. That Power and Will in God are one and the ſame: for our better conceiving of them, they may be diſtinguiſhed, but in themſelves they differ not; for <hi>Gods</hi> willing of a thing is the effecting &amp; doing of it: It is not ſo in us, for we will many things that we cannot do, but whatſoever God willeth, that he doth.</item>

Power, the Holy Ghoſts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13, 19. and Glory, the Fathers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. though indeed we may not limit our conceit of them, but underſtand them in prayer, as of the Trinity of Perſons in the Unity of the Godhead, ſo of the Unity of the Godhead in the Trinity of Perſons.</p>

                  <head>§. 1. <hi>The Creed.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe ſum of thoſe things which are to be believed, are compriſed in the Creed, commonly called, <hi>The Symbole of the Apoſtles,</hi> becauſe it is a token or profeſſion, whereby the Church, with her Members, is diſcerned from all her Enemies, and from all other Sects. This Symbole is a brief and ſummary form of Chriſtian Doctrine; or a brief ſum or Confeſſion of the Points of Chriſtian Religion, or Evangelical Doctrine; the Articles whereof are the Square or Rule, whereunto the Faith and Doctrine of all Orthodox and right believing Chriſtians ought to agree. This ſelf-ſame Symbole is called alſo <hi>Catholick,</hi> becauſe there is but one Faith of all Chriſtians; and though there were new Symboles made, as that of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> of <hi>Nice,</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> of <hi>Calcedon,</hi> yet is there not a diverſity of Faiths: for theſe are not other from this Apoſtolique Symbole, but certain words are added as an Explication of this, by reaſon of Hereticks, by whom becauſe of the ſhortneſs thereof, this was depraved. There is no change either of the Matter or of the Doctrine, but onely of the form of declaring it, as eaſily may appear by comparing them together.</p>
                  <p>This Creed is called Apoſtolique, or the Creed of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:
<list>
                        <item>1. Becauſe it containeth the ſum of the Apoſtolique Doctrine.</item>
                        <item>2. Becauſe the Apoſtles delivered that ſum of Doctrine to their Schollars and Diſciples; which the Church afterwards held as received from them: not that the Apoſtles compoſed the form of this Creed, but believed and preached the ſubject matter of it.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ends why the Creed was penn'd by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, &amp; left unto the Church, were theſe:
<list>
                        <item>1. To be a Rule of faith, and preſervation from Hereſie.</item>
                        <item>2. That it might be a mean of diſtinguiſhing betwixt true Chriſtians and Hereticks.</item>
                        <item>3. That every man entring the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, might conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually have before his eyes that Faith for which he ſhould ſuffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and to the defence whereof he ſhould ſtand unto the death.</item>
                        <item>4. That every one of the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> (which were new converted Chriſtians) might have in a readineſs what to anſwer and believe, at their initiation thereinto.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>

                  <p>The principal parts of the Apoſtolick Creed are three:
<list>
                        <item>1. Of the Father, and our Creation.</item>
                        <item>2. Of the Son, and our Redemption.</item>
                        <item>3. Of the Holy Ghoſt, and our Sanctification.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Though our Creation, Redemption and Sanctification are each appropriated to ſome one perſon of the Trinity, yet have all three Perſons their joynt-working in them: For the Creation is given to the Father, Redemption to the Son, and Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication to the Holy Ghoſt, not as they are ſimply an operation or work (for ſo ſhould the other perſons be excluded from it) but in reſpect, for the order and maner of working, which is peculiar and proper to every of them, in producing and bringing forth the ſame external work: Or thus, The works of our Creation, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Sanctification, are the operations of the Godhead outwardly; that is, external operations, which God worketh on his Creatures; and they are undi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that is, common to the three Perſons, which they by common will and power work in the Creatures, by reaſon of that one and the ſame Eſſence and Nature of the Godhead which they have; but in reſpect of that order of working which is between them, it is otherwiſe: For the Father Createth, but mediately, by the Son and the Holy Ghoſt; the Son from the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt from the Father and the Son: The Father and the Holy Ghoſt Redeem us, but mediately, by the Son; but the Son immediately, from the Father by the Holy Ghoſt: So the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son Sanctifie us, but mediately, by the Holy Ghoſt; but the Holy Ghoſt immediately, from the Father and the Son.</p>

                  <head>§. 2. <hi>I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and Earth.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THat is, I believe that God is my Father, as by Generation and Creation, ſo by Regeneration and Adoption, able to do all things as it pleaſeth him, the Creator of the whole world, and the Lord and Governor of the ſame. <hi>I believe;</hi> not we believe (with the Papiſts) as the Church believes; but every man muſt ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, as to be able to give an account of his Faith when lawfully called thereunto. Now it is one thing to believe God, another thing to believe in God; To believe God, ſheweth onely a Faith of knowledge, or hiſtorical Faith; To believe in God, declareth true Faith or confidence, that is, to be perſwaded, That whatſoever God is, and is ſaid to be, he is all that, and referreth it all to our ſafety, for his Sons ſake; that is, to reſolve that he is ſuch an one to me in particular.</p>
                  <p>God is to be conſidered in the three perſons, Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon being nothing elſe but a maner of being in the Godhead. Now no man is able to know God according to the excellency of his own Nature, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.10, 18. but the Scripture delivers us ſuch a knowledge of him, as is both neceſſary and profitable for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.19, 20. We muſt therefore acknowledge God to be ſuch as himſelf hath manifeſted himſelf to be; and though he cannot be defined, becauſe he is Immenſe,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:97622:72"/>and becauſe his Eſſence is unknown to us, yet may he be deſcribed by his Attributes and Properties, the perſons and principal works, which may be thus:</p>
                  <p>God is a Spiritual Eſſence, a Spirit, <hi>John</hi> 4.24. or ſimple Spiritual Eſſence, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.13. an everlaſting Spirit, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.17.

And in the Unity of this Godhead, there be three Perſons of one Subſtance, Power and Eternity, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.3.2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.13. Or, which Eſſence is the eternal Father, who from everlaſting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got the Son according to his Image, and the Son who is the Coeternal Image of the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt proceeding from the Father and the Son: And the Eternal Father, together with the Son and the Holy Ghoſt, hath created Heaven and Earth, and all Creatures, and worketh all good things in all: And that in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde he hath choſen unto himſelf and gathered a Church, by and for the Son, that by his Church this one and true Deity may be according to the word delivered from above, acknowledged, celebrated and adored in this life, and in the life to come: And laſtly, he is the Judge both of the juſt and unjuſt.</p>
                  <p>The Name Father, as it is oppoſite to the Son, is underſtood perſonally, or it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the firſt perſon of the Godhead, as here; but as it is referred to, or compared with the Creatures, it is taken eſſentially, ſignifying the whole Divine Nature, which is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt: And Creation is here aſcribed unto God the Father, becauſe he is the Fountain, as of the Divinity of the Son and of the Holy Ghoſt, ſo alſo of thoſe Divine operations which he worketh and performeth by the Son and the Holy Ghoſt. Now that God is, we know many ways, but chiefly by our own Conſciences, accuſing us for ſecret ſins, which cannot be but unto an infinite wiſdom, that knows the moſt ſecret thoughts of the heart, ſuch as is or can be neither Man, Devil nor Angel, but God onely.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THe whole Hiſtory of Chriſt may be comprehended in his Divinity, his Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, his Office, and his Theanthropeity. Chriſt is very God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.23. and very Man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.14. God and Man, and that in one perſon, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6, 7, 9, 11. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5, 6. and the Savior of Mankinde, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.20. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. So that in Chriſt are two perfect Natures, whole and diſtinct, and double Properties alſo, and operations natural; but one perſon, ſubſiſting in both theſe Natures, Divine and Humane: for it was requiſite that one and the ſame ſhould be Mediator both by Merit and by Power. Now Chriſt as concerning his perſon hath but one Father and one Mother; a Father as touching his Godhead, a Mother as touching his Manhood; the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> of whoſe ſubſtance he was conceived by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. So that though each Nature hath its property remaining diſtinct to it ſelf, yet are they ſo joyned, as they make but one perſon in Chriſt, who was whole God, and whole Man; whole God alſo with his body, but not according to his body, God; whole Man alſo with his Godhead, but not according to his Godhead, Man: So alſo whole Adorable with his body, but not according to his body, Adorable; whole Increate alſo with his body, but not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his body, Increated; whole Formed alſo with his Godhead, but not according to his Godhead, Formed; whole Conſubſtantial with God alſo with his body, but not according to his body, Conſubſtantial; as neither alſo is he according to his Godhead Coeſſential with men; but he is according to the Fleſh Conſubſtantial un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, exiſting alſo in his Godhead: For when we ſay he is according to the Spirit Conſubſtantial with God, we may not ſay he is according to the Spirit Coeſſential with men: And contrarily, when we affirm him to be according to the Fleſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantial with men, we may not affirm him to be according to the Fleſh Conſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial with God. The diſtinction and unconfoundableneſs of the Nature and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the Word and the Fleſh muſt thus exactly, not with a running eye, but warily be obſerved, that we may avoid the bringing in of a Diviſion of one moſt undivided perſon.</p>

<list>
                              <item>1. His Incarnation; not by turning the Godhead into the Nature of Man, but by taking Mans Nature to the Godhead, that ſo one perſon might be both God and Man.</item>
                              <item>2. His Suffering death on the croſs for our ſins.</item>

                        <item>2. In his Humane Nature he is the Image of God, and that of the whole Trinity, becauſe the three Perſons together beſtowed on Chriſts Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty theſe gifts, Properties and Majeſty, which are the Image of God.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt is called <hi>The firſt-born,</hi> in four re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. According to his Divine Nature, being begotten of the Father be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all creatures, and of the ſame ſubſtance with him, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29.</item>
                        <item>2. According to his Humane Nature, even as he took upon him our fleſh, and was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> ſo he was alſo her firſt born, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.25. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.15. Not that the bleſſed Virgin had other after him, but becauſe ſhe had none before him.</item>
                        <item>3. Becauſe he was the firſt that roſe out of the grave, and made a way for us unto everlaſting life, therefore he is called <hi>The firſt-born from the dead,</hi> Col. 1.18.</item>
                        <item>4. As the firſt-born was ſet apart, and then ſacrificed unto God; ſo Chriſt was ſeperated from ſinners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. as the unſpotted Lamb of God, holy and acceptable, and then made a perfect oblation of himſelf, not for himſelf, but for the ſins of his people, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.27.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt is ſaid to be our Lord, in three reſpects:
<list>
                        <item>1. By right of Redemption, becauſe he hath ranſomed us from our ſins.</item>
                        <item>2. By the right of Conqueſt, for he hath ſubdued the Devil, who had us in his power, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15.</item>
                        <item>3. By the right of Spiritual Marriage, becauſe he is to the Church as the Husband is to the Wife.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:97622:77"/>
                  <p>So likewiſe Chriſt is our Head, in three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects:
<list>
                        <item>1. In reſpect of his perfection, becauſe he is both God and Man; and in gifts, as touching his Humane Nature, exceedeth all creatures, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9.</item>
                        <item>2. In dignity, order, glory, majeſty, power and authority, which in his Humane Nature glorified, he now openly ſheweth forth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. &amp; 3.6.</item>
                        <item>3. In reſpect of his Office, for he is over every member of the Church, he ruleth, governeth, quickneth, nouriſheth and confirmeth them.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are alſo in three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the members of Chriſt
<list>
                        <item>1. Becauſe by Faith and the Holy Ghoſt we are joyned unto him, and alſo are knit together amongſt our ſelves as the members to the Head, and one with another.</item>
                        <item>2. Becauſe we are quickned and guided of him, and from him as the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain we draw all good things; ſo that except we continue in him, we have not eternal life in us.</item>
                        <item>3. Becauſe as in mans body are divers faculties and functions of the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; ſo are the gifts and functions divers of the members of Chriſt in the Church.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Jeſus is called <hi>Meſſias,</hi> or <hi>Chriſt,</hi> or <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed,</hi>
                     <list>

                        <item>2. In reſpect of the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, which were poured on him thick, abundantly, and moſt perfectly, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.34.</item>

And it was neceſſary that our Mediator and Deliverer ſhould be ſuch a one as was very Man, and that perfectly juſt too, becauſe the Juſtice of God requireth, that the ſame Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature which hath ſinned, do it ſelf likewiſe make recompence for ſin; and, becauſe he that is himſelf a ſinner, cannot make recompence for others, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18.

                        <item>1. That there be two Natures in Chriſt our Mediator, that in one and the ſame Chriſt are Properties diverſe and contrary, Divine and Humane, Finite and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, Paſſible and Impaſſible, and ſuch like. For the proof of his Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or that the Eternal Son, called <hi>The Word,</hi> is another Nature from the Fleſh taken, and a ſubſiſtence even before the Fleſh born of the Virgin, reade <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14, 16. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.2. who being in the form of God, took on him the form of a Servant, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6. <hi>In the Beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and that Word was God,</hi> Joh. 1.1.

                        <item>2. That theſe two Natures make but one perſon in Chriſt; or that in Chriſt are two perfect Natures, whole and diſtinct, and double properties alſo, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations natural, but one perſon; for it was requiſite that one and the ſame ſhould be Mediator both by Merit and by Power: But they who make two perſons, make alſo two Chriſts, with <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> the one a Man paſſive, and crucified, the other God, not crucified, and onely aſſiſting the Man Chriſt by his Grace. But this Hereſie hath been long ſince confuted and condemned. And that the Divine and Humane Natures of Chriſt are united in one perſon, accordeth with the holy Scripture, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.10. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5, 6. for his Humane Nature was at once both formed and aſſumed of the Word into unity of perſon, and made proper unto the Word; before or without which aſſumption or perſonal union, it neither was, nor had been, nor ſhould be.</item>

                  <head>§. 5. <hi>Suffered under</hi> Pontius Pilate, <hi>was Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, Dead and Buried; He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended into Hell.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THis <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> was a Heathen Judge, ſet over the Province of the <hi>Jews</hi> by the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor, under whoſe Government Chriſt began to execute his office for which he was ſent, and continuing therein, and working Miracles, was ſpitefully entreated of the wicked <hi>Jews</hi> for the ſpace of three years and upward, then villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſly betrayed by one of his Diſciples, apprehended, abuſed and crucified, being full Thirty three years of Age and upward; though his certain Age is not infallibly ſet down by any.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Dead</hi>] that is, On the Croſs he gave up the ghoſt, was after pierced to the very heart, ſo that water and blood came out; and being found certainly dead, he had not his legs broken as theirs were who had been crucified with him. <hi>And Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried</hi>] that is, for the more certainty that his Spirit was departed out of his body, and as for the confirmation of his death, ſo for the myſtery of our not onely death, but burial unto ſin figured thereby, he was taken down from the Croſs, and laid in the Grave or Sepulchre. Now it is one thing to believe that Chriſt ſuffered, another to believe in Chriſt which ſuffered; for that is onely to have an Hiſtorical Faith of Chriſts Paſſion, without repoſing any confidence therein: but this is to believe not onely that Chriſt ſuffered, but alſo to repoſe and place our truſt and confidence in Chriſts Suffering and Paſſion.</p>
                  <p>For the right apprehenſion of the ſuffering of Chriſt being God-Man, know, That the Deity ſimply conſidered in it ſelf and by it ſelf, could not dye; but that perſon which was God, both could and did dye: For the Son of God aſſuming an Humane Nature unto the Unity of his Divine Nature, and uniting them together without confuſion, alteration, diſtraction, ſeparation, in one perſon, that which is done by the one Nature, is done by the perſon; in which reſpect the Scripture often attributeth the Suffering of Chriſt to the other Nature, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. And though the Divine Nature of Chriſt ſuffered not, yet did it ſupport the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and added dignity, worth and efficacy to the ſuffering of that Nature; yea, it had alſo proper and peculiar works, as to Sanctifie his Humane Nature, to take away our ſins, to reconcile us to God, and the like. And this muſt be cautiouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by us for a Rule, That Chriſt is not dead for us, except we be dead to ſin; neither is he riſen again for us, except we be riſen again to newneſs of life. And take this for a moſt ſure Principle, That we are not Redeemed, except we be Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; for he did not Redeem us from ſin, that we ſhould commit it afreſh and ſerve it again. It is one thing to know that Chriſt dyed, another thing that he dyed for us; and it is one thing to diſcourſe paſſionately of his death, another to feel the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof within us: Labor therefore to be ſo affected therewith, as that it may effectually prove thy death unto ſin.</p>
                  <p>Chriſt deſcended into Hell for us, when after the very time of his Paſſion, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for a time in the ſtate of the Dead, and was under the power of the Grave. This Article of Chriſts Deſcenſion into Hell, is to be underſtood of the Grave, not of his Souls going down locally into the place of the Damned, not onely of thoſe inexpreſſible, yea unconceiveable torments which he ſuffered in his Soul under the eclipſe of Gods favor, yea under the fearful wrath of God, which though in reſpect of us was to be eternal, in him was made temporary, having end, becauſe himſelf is Eternal and Infinite: So that to believe in Jeſus Chriſt which deſcended into Hell, is to believe that Chriſt was for a time in the ſtate of the Dead, and held under the power of the Grave.</p>

They which underſtand it of ſome place thereabout, ſay, That he went thither, and that by a local deſcenſion (as the Papiſts aſſirm) to deliver the Fathers and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, that were detained, as they dream, for their Original ſin in <hi>Limbo.</hi> The grounds pretended for both, are alleaged out of <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.25.

                  <p>TO believe in Chriſt riſen from the dead, is to believe that he ſhook off death from himſelf, quickned his dead body, reunited his body unto his ſoul, reſtored unto himſelf a bleſſed, celeſtial and glorious life, and that by his own proper power.

This is that Holy One, of whom <hi>David</hi> propheſied, that <hi>He ſhould not ſee corruption,</hi> Pſal. 16.10. who but a little before his death told his Diſciples himſelf, that <hi>The third day he would riſe again,</hi> Mark 9.31. &amp; 10.34. The accompliſhment of which Truth, ſtands on ſacred Record, both by his appearing (after that he was riſen from death to life) to <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> Joh. 20.14. to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers women, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.9. to two, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.13, 15. to ten, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.19. to all the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to more then five hundred at once, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.6. to ſundry perſons by the ſpace of forty days together, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.3. and by the teſtimony alſo of the Apoſtles, <hi>Peter,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:97622:83"/>Acts</hi> 1.22. and <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 17.2, 3. So that whoever is a perverſe Sadduce to this Truth, ſtrikes at the very Root of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He aſcended into Heaven</hi>] that is, he being revived from the dead (his ſoul coming again into his body) walking here a while upon the Earth for the ſpace of forty days, eating and drinking ſometimes with his Diſciples, not for any need of ſuſtenance, but for the more aſſurance of his Reſurrection, and offering his body to be felt and handled, comforting and inſtructing them, and then in the open ſight of them all, he went up body and ſoul into the Heavens, they looking and marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at it. This was foretold by <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 68.18. and by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 14.2. &amp; 20.17. was prefigured in <hi>Enoch, Gen.</hi> 5.24. and in <hi>Elias,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 2. and witneſſed, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.22. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.10. ſo that Chriſts Aſcenſion is a local, true, real, and viſible Aſcenſion, Tranſlation, or removing of Chriſts body from Earth into Heaven, which is above all viſible Heavens, to Gods right hand, where he now is, and whence he ſhall come to Judgement, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.11. This his Aſcenſion muſt be underſtood of his Humanity onely, for his Divinity was always in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And there he ſitteth at Gods right hand</hi>] that is, he is a perſon equal to God in Power and Glory, by whom the Father worketh immediately; or to ſit at Gods right hand, is to raign in equal Power and Glory with the Father: for Chriſt doth all things likewiſe as doth the Father, and is endued with the ſame Power with the Father, which alſo he exerciſeth: He is that perſon Omnipotent, by which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther governeth all things immediately; but eſpecially by which he defendeth the Church againſt her Enemies; and this indeed is the proper meaning of Chriſts ſeſſion at the right hand of the Father.</p>

And in this laſt Judgement, Abſolution to the godly ſhall be principally according to the Goſpel, but ſhall be confirmed by the Law; Condemnation to the wicked ſhall be principally by the Law, but ſhall be confirmed of the Goſpel: Sentence ſhall be given on the wicked according to their own Merit, but on the godly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Chriſts Merit, applyed unto them by faith; a Teſtimony and Witneſs of which Faith, ſhall be their Works.

                        <item>3. The World, Heaven and Earth ſhall be diſſolved by fire at the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Judgement; there ſhall be a change of this preſent ſtate, and a purifying of the creatures, but not a conſuming of them.</item>

                        <item>1. By his viſible Apparitions, <hi>Luke</hi> 3.22.</item>
                        <item>2. Becauſe he is called <hi>God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 5.3, 4.</item>
                        <item>3. Becauſe he is the Author of our Baptiſm, and we are Baptized in his Name.</item>
                        <item>4. The Properties of a perſon are all attributed unto him, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.12. <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.13.</item>
                        <item>5. Becauſe he is plainly diſtinguiſhed from the gifts and graces of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4, 11.</item>

                  <p>The Holy Ghoſt is a perſon diſtinct from the Father and the Son, for theſe Reaſons:
<list>

                        <item>2. The Holy Ghoſt in expreſs words is called <hi>Another</hi> from them both, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16.</item>
                        <item>3. He is ſent of the Father and the Son, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.26. therefore another from them both.</item>

                  <head>§. 9. <hi>The Holy Catholique Church.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>Concerning the holy and Catholique Church of Chriſt, we believe, That the Son of God doth from the beginning of the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.11. <hi>Gen.</hi> 26.4. to the end thereof, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. gather, defend and preſerve unto himſelf by his Spirit, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.21. and Word, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.46. out of whole Mankinde, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.28. a company choſen to everlaſting life, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.21. and agreeing in true faith; And that we are lively Members of that Company, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.19. and ſo ſhall remain for ever, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 18.9. To believe in which holy Catholique Church, is to believe the Doctrine thereof, wherein ſhe followeth Chriſt, the Prophets and Apoſtles, the onely ſure ground and pillar of Truth; and that in this viſible Company and Society are ſome true Repentants and truly converted, and my ſelf to be a lively Member of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible and viſible Church: So that to believe and confeſs the Doctrine of Salvation taught and delivered by the Prophets and Apoſtles, is an infallible and inſeperable note of a true Church of God; for Gods Church is nothing elſe, but a company of Gods people, called by the Doctrine of the Prophets and Apoſtles, unto the ſtate of Salvation; ſo that out of the Church there is no Salvation ordinarily: In which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark was a true Type of the Church, none being ſaved from drowning that were out of it. And none but ſuch who are of Chriſts body, ſhall partake of the benefits of his Office; for himſelf ſaith, <hi>He prays not for the world,</hi> Joh. 17.9. In which reſpect alſo out of the Church no Salvation, for the body being the true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Inviſible Church, he that is not a member of this body is out of the Church, and ſo hath not Chriſt to be his Head and Savior: Yea, the Church is alſo Chriſts Spouſe; the many eſpouſal Titles which in Scripture are given to Chriſt and the Church, in mutual relation of one to another, evidently declareth as much: He is ſtiled <hi>a Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom,</hi> ſhe <hi>a Bride,</hi> Joh. 3.29. He <hi>Well-beloved,</hi> ſhe <hi>Love, Cant.</hi> 1.13, 15. He <hi>an Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> ſhe <hi>a Wiſe,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. He <hi>an Head,</hi> ſhe <hi>the Body,</hi> both <hi>one fleſh,</hi> Eph. 5.23, 31. Thus the Church being the <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi> ſanctified in Chriſt Jeſus, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him the Son of the living God, in every place knit in one Church as the Body,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:97622:88"/>and every Member unto Chriſt as unto one Head, it is moſt evident that no man can be ſaved out of the Church: for whomſoever God hath choſen and elected to the end, which is eternal life, them he hath choſen to the means, which is the inward and outward calling. But here note, That Infants born in the Church, are in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to be reputed of the Church, till at their mature Age their life notoriouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the contrary.</p>
                  <p>The Church is called <hi>Catholique</hi> or <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal,</hi> becauſe it is not now tyed to any certain place or people, as it was under the Law, before the coming of Chriſt. Now the Doctrine of the true Church conſiſteth in the Sentences and Decrees, which we are bound by the Commandment of God to believe and obey; and no Doctrine is to be propoſed to the Church, that is repugnant to the holy Scripture, or not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein. And the Church hath Authority to judge and determine in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies of Faith, according to Scripture; to interpret and expound the Word of God, with reſpect to the Analogy of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.6. And though ſhe be the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Keeper of Gods written Word, yet may not inforce any thing to be believed as neceſſary to Salvation, that is either contrary or beſide the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>The viſible Church is a company among men, imbracing and profeſſing the true and uncorrupt Doctrine of the Law and the Goſpel, and uſing the Sacraments aright, according to Chriſts Inſtitution, and profeſſing Obedience unto the Doctrine; in which company are many ungenerate or hypocrites, conſenting notwithſtanding to the Doctrine. The inviſible Church is a company of thoſe which are Elected to eternal life, in whom a new life is begun here by the Holy Ghoſt, and is perfected in the world to come: They which are in this inviſible Church, never periſh, neither are any hypocrites therein. And it is called <hi>Inviſible,</hi> not that the men are inviſible, but becauſe their Faith is ſo, that we cannot certainly diſcern the godly from the hypocrites. And although this Univerſal inviſible Church, is that Militant Church which remaineth as yet in the field, and is fighting on Earth, yet it is, and lieth hid in the viſible Church; ſo that in this reſpect, there is as it were no more difference between them, then between a whole and a part. Now thoſe viſible Churches which refuſe to be governed by Chriſts Word, but are by Humane Traditions play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Adultereſſes by committing Idolatry, are not of this Catholique Church which is ſubject to Chriſt; neither are Infidels that defie Chriſt, Hereticks that deny him, Ignorant perſons that know not his Will, Prophane perſons that deſpiſe, Worldlings that lightly eſteem him, nor any that perſecute or ſcorn him in his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. Thus many have a Name of being of the Church, who indeed are not. And as for the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they are departed from the Truth, they have denyed the Faith, they have defiled themſelves with Idols, they will not have Chriſts Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs imputed to them; they ſet up their own Works, and ſeek Juſtification by them; they will not receive Chriſt to be their onely King and Prieſt, they will merit Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for themſelves, and therefore they are not a true, but a falſe Church.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>Church</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth an Aſſembly called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: which calling is twofold; <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <head>§. 10. <hi>The Communion of Saints.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe Communion of Saints, is that holy and ſweet fellowſhip which all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſts Church have with their Head Chriſt Jeſus, and one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, whether they are Believers here, or departed. Nor is this the leaſt of Chriſts benefits beſtowed on the Church by the Holy Ghoſt: For herein all the Saints have the ſame Reconciliation, the ſame Redemption, the ſame Righteouſneſs, the ſame Sanctification, the ſame Salvation, by and for Chriſt; All the Saints have the ſame benefits common, which are neceſſary to Salvation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.4. And all the like ſpecial gifts, though not all a like meaſure, but are ſo diſtributed to every Member, as that ſome excel others in gifts and graces in the Church: for the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt are diverſe, and <hi>to every one of us is given grace, according to the meaſure of the gift of Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 4.7.</p>
                  <p>The chief part of the Communion of Saints, is the union or coherence of all the Saints; that is, of the whole body of the Church, with Chriſt the Head, and of his Members among themſelves, which is wrought by the Holy Ghoſt, even by the ſame
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:97622:91"/>Spirit, who dwelleth in Chriſt the Head, and in all his Members: So that to believe the Communion of Saints, is to believe, That the Saints (of which number I muſt needs certainly be aſſured my ſelf to be one) are united by the Spirit unto Chriſt their Head, and that from the Head gifts are poured down unto them, both thoſe which are the ſame in all neceſſary to Salvation; as alſo thoſe which being diverſe, and diverſly beſtowed upon every one, are requiſite for the edification of the Church: And that they are by the ſame Spirit likewiſe united among themſelves. The my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical union between Chriſt and every true Believer is not onely in regard of ſoul, but of body alſo; which being once knit, ſhall never be diſſolved, but is eternal: whereupon, the dying, dead, rotten and conſumed body remaineth ſtill a Member of Chriſt, abideth within the Covenant, and is and ſhall be ever a Temple of the Holy Ghoſt. Touching which union in regard of the ſoul, Chriſt dwelleth therein, or in the heart of every true Believer, as the ſoul in the body, and acts the ſoul, as the ſoul acts the body, without whom the ſoul is dead to all goodneſs: So that if thou finde that thou art no more able to pray, nor no more able to do any duty then thou waſt before, that thou liveſt in thy luſts as much as ever thou didſt, that thou haſt not that new heart, that new Spirit, that new affection which the Scriptures ſpeak of, then be ſure that Chriſt dwelleth not in thy heart, thou haſt no communion with him or his Saints.</p>
                  <p>The Union of Chriſt and the Church is a great Myſtery, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.32. not to be meaſured with the line of our own Reaſon, which can never fathom the depth thereof; a Secret that could not be opened but by Divine Revelation, nor being opened, can be conceived, but by the illumination of the Spirit. Thus though it be above our capacity, yet being revealed, we muſt believe it, as we do the myſtery of the Trinity, of Chriſts Eternal generation, of the Perſonal Union of his two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, of the Proceeding of the Holy Ghoſt, and the like. So that in our Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Myſtery, we muſt conceive no carnal, no earthly thing of it, becauſe it is a Myſtery; it is altogether Spiritual and heavenly. From the natural Union of our head and body, and from the Matrimonial Union of man and wife, we may by way of reſemblance but help our underſtanding in the Union of Chriſt and his Church; but notwithſtanding the compariſons, we may not draw the Myſtery it ſelf to any carnal matter, for it is onely and wholly Spiritual. This plainly diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereth the ſtrange folly of the Papiſts, who make our Union with Chriſt meerly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, conceiving it to conſiſt in a corporal commixion of Chriſts fleſh with ours; in which conceit there is a great deal of groſs abſurdity, no great Myſtery. Now the maner of our Union with Chriſt, is not by being united onely to his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but by being united to Chriſts Perſon, God-Man: For as his Divine Nature in and by it ſelf is incommunicable; ſo the Humane Nature ſimply conſidered in and by it ſelf, is unprofitable: for the Deity is the Fountain of Life and Grace, which through the Humanity of Chriſt is conveyed unto us. And though he be in heaven and we on earth, yet this Union being ſupernatural and Spiritual, there needeth no local preſence for the making of it; the Spirit of Chriſt being conveyed into every of the Saints, as the ſoul into every part of the body, makes the Members one Myſtical Body their Head.</p>

                  <p>The faithful are called Saints in three reſpects:
<list>
                        <item>1. Imputatively; that is, in reſpect that Chriſts ſanctity and holineſs is imputed unto them.</item>
                        <item>2. Inchoatively; that is, in reſpect that conformity and agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with the Law, is inchoated or begun in them.</item>
                        <item>3. In reſpect of their ſeparation; becauſe they are ſelected and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from all other men.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>Union is taken three ways:
<list>
                        <item>1. Eſſentially; ſo God is not one with us, nor we with him: for there is no proportion between finite and infinite.</item>
                        <item>2. Perſonally or hypoſtatically, as when things are ſo joyned, that they make one perſon; neither thus is God one with us, or we with him.</item>
                        <item>3. Spiritually, which is the conjunction of us with God, and God with us, whereby we are one with him in Chriſt, and he in Chriſt with us: Thus we are ſaid to be in Chriſt as our Savior, not as God onely, or Man onely, but as both, one Chriſt.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Bond whereby we are united to Chriſt, is twofold:
<list>
                        <item>1. One on Chriſts part, even the Spirit of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.13.</item>
                        <item>2. The other on our part, which is Faith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>So likewiſe we are ſaid to be in Chriſt two ways; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. In regard of the external conjunction of his Body the Church, by which we are initiate into his Name by Baptiſm: This is common both to true and falſe Chriſtians.</item>
                        <item>2. By the true internal coadunation or conjunction of the Spirit, which is proper onely to the Elect.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>The three ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Vertues which unite us to Chriſt:
<list>
                        <item>1. Faith, the hand whereby we lay hold on him, as he by his Spirit doth on us.</item>
                        <item>2. Hope, the anchor whereby we hold faſt what we have laid hold on, maugre all the ſtorms and aſſaults of Satan.</item>
                        <item>3. Love, the glew or ſodder whereby we are thus knit and united to him, and become one with him.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Chriſt is ſaid to be preſent with us, in five reſpects; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. By his Spirit and Godhead.</item>
                        <item>2. As touching our faith and confidence wherewith we behold him.</item>
                        <item>3. In mutual dilection and love.</item>
                        <item>4. In reſpect of his Union with Humane Nature; that is, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the ſoul with the body.</item>
                        <item>5. In reſpect of that hope which we have of our conſummation or coming unto him.</item>

                        <item>3. By conjunction and union; not by any natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion of Chriſt and our fleſh, but by Faith and the Holy Ghoſt, in Chriſt our Head, and dwelling in us his Members, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. we are Members of his Body, of his Fleſh, and his Bones, and of they twain ſhall be one fleſh, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.30.

                  <head>§. 11. <hi>The forgiveneſs of Sins.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>BY which Article is underſtood, That all our ſins, wants and imperfections, Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and Actual, as well in the committing of evil, as in the omitting of good, in thought, word and deed, are covered, healed and releaſed, through the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt imputed unto us: which being apprehended by faith, and applyed unto us, doth not onely make them as if they had never been, but alſo juſtifieth and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chargeth us, cauſing us to appear blameleſs and ſpotleſs in the ſight of God. This forgiveneſs of Sins comprehendeth under it, as it were in a ſhort ſum, all the Mercies of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.1. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 2.7. it being the Will of God, which to the Faithful and Elect imputeth not any ſin, and therefore doth in like ſort love them, as if they had never ſinned, and delivereth them from all puniſhment of ſin, and giveth them Eternal life freely, for the Interceſſion and Merit of Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, our Savior and Mediator: So that Remiſſion of ſins is from God onely; the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters indeed and the Church, are ſaid to remit ſins, but onely as they are ſignifiers and declarers of Gods Remiſſion, when according to the Commandment of God, the Church denounceth to the Repentant: And one Neighbor remits Treſpaſſes unto another, as concerning the perſonal pardoning of the offence; but God onely freeth us from the guilt of ſin, by his own Authority, and that freely in reſpect of us, though it coſt Chriſt full dear. Now the onely ground upon which we are perſwaded of the forgiveneſs of our ſins, ſhould be, That we have Chriſt; <hi>For he that hath the Son hath life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the greateſt of all the Promiſes, in laying hold whereof, the underſtanding muſt be rightly informed what ground a man hath to do it, not in a confuſed maner without a clear knowledge of the progreſs of Faith; and then it is the work of God onely, to draw the will to take the Promiſes, after that the underſtanding right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly apprehends them, for both theſe are required in a juſtifying Faith. From all
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:97622:93"/>which it appears, That it is not a Doctrine of Pride and Preſumption (as the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue of <hi>Rome</hi> teacheth) to believe the Remiſſion of our own ſins; for generally to believe that God forgiveth ſin, or that ſome men have their ſins forgiven, is no Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the Church, but the common faith of the Devils, <hi>James</hi> 2.19. All the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles contain the confeſſion of a ſpecial Faith, and a particular application to our ſelves. As I muſt believe God the Father to be my Creator, the Son my Redeemer, the Holy Ghoſt to be my Sanctifier; ſo I am bound to believe the Remiſſion of my own ſins, the Reſurrection of my own body, and that life everlaſting ſhall be given to me: This ſpecial Faith muſt be the Faith of us all, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20.</p>
                  <p>The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of our ſins is known by theſe two ſigns; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. By an humble and hearty Confeſſion of our ſins unto God, wherein we muſt acknowledge all our main ſins, both Original and Actual, our guiltineſs before God, and our juſt deſert of Damnation for the ſame.</item>
                        <item>2. By the rightly pacified Conſcience, which is done by Faith in the heart: And the Peace here meant, is ſuch a Peace as cometh after War, after conflicts for ſin, after knowledge of Gods diſpleaſure with thee, after the ſenſe hereof, and after all this, a knowledge of Reconciliation again. Now many in an evil eſtate live and dye peaceably; but deceive not thy ſelf, that is onely becauſe they were never acquainted with the Doctrine of Juſtification and Sanctification, becauſe they never ſaw the danger: for to be ſure that I am free from a danger, and not to know a danger, is all one, and doth breed a like confidence and ſecurity. Thus as it is a great mercy to have a true and ſound Peace: ſo to have a Peace not well grounded and bottom'd, is the moſt dangerous Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the world. That thou mayeſt therefore the better judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou haſt this Sign of the forgiveneſs of thy ſin, know, That this Peace is threefold:

                        <item>4. Not to have in any account the Popes Indulgence for ſins, but to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor his Blaſphemous Pardon for them, ſeeing this is in Gods power onely.</item>

                        <item>3. It pleaſeth God many times to leave men to themſelves, and to ſuffer them to commit ſome ſin that woundeth Conſcience; but yet we may not hence think that he is the Author thereof, but our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Nature.</item>
                        <item>4. The Promiſes of God touching Remiſſion of ſins and life eternal, in reſpect of Believers, are general; and in regard of all and every man, indefinite.</item>

                  <head>§. 12. <hi>The Reſurrection of the Body.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THe Reſurrection of the Fleſh, is a reſtoring of the ſubſtance of our Bodies after Death, even of the ſame matter whereof they now conſiſt, and a reviving and quickning of the ſame bodies with life incorruptible, by the ſame Immortal Soul whereby they now live, which God will work by Chriſt in the end of the world, by his Divine Vertue and Power: which reſtoring alſo ſhall be of the Elect unto the Eternal Glory of God, but of the Reprobate unto Eternal Pains. Thus although the body after death lie rotting in the Grave, yet at the laſt day it ſhall be raiſed again by Gods great Power; and being joyned to the Soul, ſhall ſtand before Gods Judgement Seat, to give account of all it hath done, whether good or evil, and be rewarded accordingly. When Chriſt as Man (for thus onely he can remove from place to place, his Godhead ever filling all places) ſhall come down viſibly and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with great Glory, and Troops of Angels about him, to Judge thoſe that ſhall be then living, for the world ſhall be full of people even to the hour of his coming; and then the Dead being raiſed out of their Graves, even all from the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſhall be joyned with the living (who ſhall onely in ſtead of dying be changed) and thus all people together, of all Countreys and Nations, ſhall be preſented before his Tribunal, to receive Sentence according to the Equity, yea and Juſtice of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, whether of Abſolution, to paſs into the Kingdom of his Father, or of Condemnation, into the Kingdom of Hell, with the Devil and his Angels for ever.</p>
                  <p>Now though amongſt thoſe that dye, ſome are crooked through Age, ſome ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Infants, ſome Blinde, and ſome Lame, yet at the Reſurrection theſe weakneſſes ſhall be done away to the faithful, and ſtrength, perfection and comelineſs ſhall be to every one of them. The bodies indeed of the Elect ſhall riſe in the ſame ſubſtance as the bodies of the Reprobate, but diverſe in quality, not to be corrupted or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered any more: And theſe qualities of the bodies of the juſt after the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, ſhall be Clarity, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. Impaſſibility, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Agility, <hi>Wiſd.</hi> 4. and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty; now the condition of the unjuſt ſhall be quite contrary to the bleſſed: So that although the Reſurrection is one of the Priviledges which the Saints, by vertue of their Union with Chriſt, receive after death, yet Reſurrection ſimply in it ſelf conſidered, is not the Priviledge of Saints, but Reſurrection of life; to the wicked appertaineth the Reſurrection of condemnation. The benefit of Reſurrection, ariſeth from the Glory which followeth thereupon in Heaven, where the Saints ſhall ſhine as Precious Stones, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.11. yea, as the Firmament, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.3. as the Stars and as the Sun, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.43. be like Chriſt himſelf, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. and appear with him in glory, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4. This glory of the Saints extendeth both to Soul and Body, to the whole perſon: In regard of their Souls, they ſhall be all glorious within, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.13. for <hi>they are Spirits of juſt men made perfect,</hi> Heb. 12.23. perfect knowledge, wiſdom, and all maner of purity ſhall be in them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. In regard of their Bodies, they ſhall be faſhioned like to Chriſts glorious body, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. and that in Incorruption, Immortality, Beauty, Brightneſs, Grace, Favor, Agility, Strength, and the like, ſuch as indeed the tongue of Men or Angels is not able to expreſs: Suffice it to our raviſhed Admiration, That the Saints, in regard of their perſons, ſhall there be advanced to the Honor and Dignity of Chriſt, ſo far as they are capable of it. The Reſurrection we are to hope for, as it is an effect of Gods Counſel; and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, as it is the Counſel it ſelf, and Purpoſe of God.</p>

                     <hi>Iſraels</hi> deſcent into the Red-Sea, and the Lords deliverance of them thence, The flouriſhing of <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod, <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Viſion of dead bones, The Jews Captivity in, and deliverance from <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Jonahs</hi> preſervation in and from the Belly of the Whale, are all Types of the Reſurrection: And if the Doctrine of the Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be ſhaken and overturned, then all Religion is pulled up by the Roots; let us therefore beware of ſuch Vipers as lurk in the boſom of the Church. There were even among the people of God Sadduces, that taught that man periſhed wholly, and that after death there ſhould be no riſing or returning to life, but that he periſhed as the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:97622:96"/>Beaſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.23. And in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> ſome were found, which ſaid, <hi>There is no Reſurrection of the dead,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.12. Some have confeſſed indeed the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the ſoul (ſo alſo did ſome of the Heathen) but touching the Reſurrection, they have fancied it to be in this life, and not after death; as if the Reſurrection were nothing elſe but Regeneration, a dying to ſin, and riſing again to newneſs of life; or not unlike to <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> who ſaid, That <hi>the Reſurrection was already paſt,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.18. This Hereſie, for its continuance, is not a little beholding to the <hi>Family of Love,</hi> who hold that Heaven and Hell are in this life, and no other Reſurrection of the body, or day of Judgement, or coming of Chriſt, then in this world: Nor is it much leſs beholding to the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> who deny that the ſame bodies which now we have, and ſhall lie in the duſt, ſhall ever riſe again; but hold, That God at the ſecond coming of Chriſt will make us new bodies: This is to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a New Creation of new bodies, and to deny the Reſurrection of the former. But all thoſe Hereſies we are to abandon, and to let our Faith cloſe with the Will of God, revealed in his Word, as we tender the benefit we expect by the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>

                  <p>BY <hi>Life Everlaſting,</hi> is meant that ever-enduring happineſs, and all thoſe joys which the Lord imparteth to all his Elect in the world to come; not onely Life in, but Joy; not onely Joy, but Riches; not onely Riches, but Glory; and all theſe not in ſome meaſure, but in exceſs; not mixed, but abſolute; without grief, without want, without diſhonor; not by intermiſſion and fits, but continually; not after ſome long time to end, but everlaſtingly. This is the bleſſed eſtate of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the world to come, without end or miſery, in joys unſpeakable in body and ſoul; that habitation or dwelling of God in Angels and Men by the Holy Ghoſt, and the true knowledge of God, his Will and all his Works, kindled by the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in their hearts, and true and perfect Righteouſneſs and Wiſdom, that is a perfect conformity and correſpondence of their will and powers and operations, with the Minde and Will of God; as alſo a joy reſting on God, and a ſufficiency of all good things in God, as touching both ſoul and body, which ſhall never be interrupted, hindred, or have an end, which is given to all the Elect, and to them onely, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.28. Now as they are Elected, ſo they are but choſen to Eternal life: but as they are converted, ſo they are in part admitted unto it, and begin to be put into poſſeſſion of it. Thus the ſouls of the faithful departed, do in a moſt happy and bleſſed eſtate tarry and wait for their full deliverance and Redemption, in the Reſurrection and Glorification of their bodies; in the mean time reſting from their labors, being in the hand of God, the true Paradice and Kingdom of Chriſt, are received of him, and gathered to the ſouls of the faithful which are perfected, and to <hi>Abraham</hi> the Father of all which believe. Whence this Article is added in our Creed, to ſignifie, That the juſt ſhall not riſe again to miſery, or to a momentary felicity, but to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal bleſſedneſs: The main difference betwixt our eſtate in this world and in the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:97622:96"/>world to come, being, That here we muſt believe what we know but in part; there we ſhall perfectly know whatſoever is to be believed.</p>
                  <p>The comfort which the faithful take in this Article of Everlaſting Life, is, That foraſmuch as they feel already in their hearts the beginning of Everlaſting life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2, 3. it ſhall at length come to paſs, That after this life they ſhall enjoy full and perfect bliſs, wherein they ſhall magnifie God for ever: which bleſſedneſs, neither eye hath ſeen, nor ear hath heard, neither hath any man in thought conceived it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. and which life we begin to live, the ſoul entreth into it at the time of every faithful ones bodily death, and the body alſo at the time of the general Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for there is no ſleeping of the ſoul, as ſome dream, neither any other place to keep it in, nor ever was.</p>
                  <p>To believe ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, is to be aſſuredly and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly perſwaded,

                        <item>2. We ſhall Reſt from all troubles and miſeries of this life, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. hence it is called <hi>Abrahams boſom,</hi> Luke 16.22, 23. which in the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful is even in this life begun by the outward Miniſtery of the Word, and the inward Miniſtery of the Spirit; the conſummation whereof hereafter ſhall never be given, to whom the beginning thereof, that is, Faith and Converſion, hath not arrived in this life.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>The life of Life Everlaſting, is, the Beatifical Viſion, or the perfect Viſion of God, when Gods Elect ſhall ſee him as he is, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. Yet that we be not deceived herein, we muſt know that perfect ſight is twofold; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Simple Perfect Sight, when man ſees a thing wholly as it is in it ſelf; and thus God is not ſeen by the minde of man.</item>
                        <item>2. Comprehenſive Perfect Sight, when the creature ſeeth God, ſo far forth as it is capable of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and thus ſhall men ſee God in the world to come perfectly, and be filled therewith, though they know him not wholly as he is in himſelf; even as a veſſel caſt into the Sea may be perfectly full of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though it receive not all the water in the Sea.</item>

                        <item>2. To ſtrive to enter, and to walk on in the way that leadeth to everlaſting life, and never to go out of it to our dying day, and this is the way of good works, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.29.</item>
                        <item>3. To uſe the remembrance of eternal life, as a ſalve againſt all ſores, as a Cordial to comfort our hearts againſt our greateſt heavineſs.</item>
                        <item>4. To pray that this time might be haſtned wherein we ſhall enter into life, and even to rejoyce when we ſee it approach to any of us in particular.</item>

                  <p>THe Commandments were given about Two thouſand five hundred years after the Creation; not that men were left all this time without Law, for there was a Law written in their hearts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. but to make that more plain, which by the corruption of Nature was become very dim and much defaced; ſo that as long as men have been, there hath alſo been a Law, although not expreſſed in words, yet written in the heart: wherefore if it be well obſerved, we ſhall finde, That even before the giving of the Law, all the Precepts of the Ten Commandments were in a maner known and acknowledged, though they require whatſoever was commanded <hi>Adam</hi> in his Integrity, and whatſoever was commanded ſince, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.16, 17. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. The Law being that which God himſelf delivered to his people by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which alſo with his own finger he wrote in two Tables of Stone, called <hi>The Moral Law,</hi> becauſe it ſheweth the Vertues to be followed, and the Vices to be avoided; as alſo to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh it from the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> which comprehendeth the Ceremonies preſcribed by God in the old Church; and from the <hi>Judicial</hi> and <hi>Political Laws,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Judgements, and the Penalties to be inflicted on the breakers of this Moral Law: The ſum whereof is this, The Firſt Table, containing the four firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, Commandeth all the Duties which man oweth to God; The Second Table, containing the ſix laſt Commandments, commandeth all that Man oweth to Man, according to the Will of God. For the Commandments of the Latter Table are to be referred to the firſt, that is to ſay, They are to be kept, not indeed ſo much for our Neighbors ſake, as for Gods ſake, of whom they are commanded: the Firſt Table being immediately, the Second mediately referred unto God; the Commandments whereof are not notwithſtanding leſs then thoſe of the Firſt Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but the principal ſervice of the Firſt Table, is greater then the principal ſervice of the Second, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.37, 38.</p>
                  <p>Inſtances of Scripture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that the Decalogue was in mans heart before it was written in the two Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of Stone:
<list>
                        <item>1. The Firſt Commandment was known unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> when as almoſt in ſo many words the Lord ſaid unto him, <hi>I am God All-ſufficient, ſtand before me, and be upright,</hi> Gen. 17.1. And <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid, <hi>Put away the ſtrange gods,</hi> Gen. 35.2.</item>
                        <item>2. The Second was alſo known unto <hi>Jacob,</hi> for he purged his houſe from Idols when he was to build an Altar in <hi>Bethel, Gen.</hi> 35.2. Acknowledging hereby that this was a Corruption, which the true God would be offended at.</item>
                        <item>3. The Third <hi>Abraham</hi> alſo ſeemeth to have well known, when he ſware by the true God unto <hi>Abimelech,</hi> to confirm his League, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.23. And <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he ſware unto <hi>Laban</hi> by <hi>the fear of his father Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 31.53.</item>
                        <item>4. The Fourth is recorded by <hi>Moſes</hi> to have been given in Paradice, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.2, 3. And is likewiſe ſet down in <hi>Exodus</hi> 16.23.</item>
                        <item>5. The Fifth <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhewed in his practice, when he followed his Fathers direction in taking a wife; and his children by going at his command into <hi>Egypt;</hi> and <hi>Joſephs</hi> nouriſhing him there in his old age: <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Japheth</hi> reverencing their Father <hi>Noah,</hi> are bleſſed; but <hi>Ham</hi> ſcorning him, is curſed in his Son <hi>Canaan, Gen.</hi> 9.25, 26.</item>

                        <item>6. The Sixth was written in <hi>Cain</hi>'s Conſcience, which made him cry, <hi>My ſin is greater then can be forgiven;</hi> and God expreſly forbiddeth it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.6.</item>
                        <item>7. The Seventh was to be ſeen in the Sons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> when they ſaid, <hi>Should he make our Siſter a whore?</hi> Gen. 34.31. In <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when his Miſtris tempted him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.9. and in <hi>Judah,</hi> when he commanded <hi>Thamar</hi> to be burnt, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.2.</item>
                        <item>8. The Eighth <hi>Laban</hi> urgeth upon <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 31.30. who acknowledgeth Death to be due for it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45.5. And <hi>Jacobs</hi> Sons ſay, <hi>God forbid that we ſhould ſteal,</hi> Gen. 44.</item>
                        <item>9. The Ninth, Heathen <hi>Abimelech</hi> ſhewed to be written in his heart, when he complained of <hi>Abrahams</hi> falſe teſtimony touching his Wife, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.9. &amp; 26.9. And of <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s for the like; yea, and <hi>Judah</hi> kept promiſe, not lying or deceiving, <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.20.</item>
                        <item>10. The Tenth <hi>Abraham</hi> ſheweth to be written in his heart, when having recovered the goods of <hi>Sodom,</hi> he coveted none of them being other mens; and it was ſin to look on a woman to luſt after her, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed even in Kings, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.17. &amp; 20.7.</item>

                     <list>
                        <item>1. There was great preparation three days together, the people were ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified according to the maner of thoſe times, by Waſhings and Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyings: So let us prepare our ſelves by prayer, before we come to hear the Lord ſpeaking unto us in the Miniſtery of his holy Word.</item>
                        <item>2. A ſtrict charge was given them, That neither man nor beaſt on pain of death ſhould come near the Mount, whence the Law was to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered: how much leſs mercy deſerved the Tranſgreſſors of theſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Laws?</item>
                        <item>3. The Lord deſcended with great terror, the Trumpet ſounding, the Earth ſhaking, and Lightnings flying about: Shewing with what fear of offending againſt thoſe weighty Laws they were to be received into the heart.</item>
                        <item>4. Almighty God himſelf ſpake all theſe words in the hearing of all the people, and afterward writ them in two Tables of Stone with his own finger; intimating hereby the perpetuity of them, and how ſtony-hard our hearts be, that the finger of God alone is able to imprint them there.</item>
                        <item>5. When <hi>Moſes</hi> had broken theſe two Tables, the Lord writ the ſame words in two other Tables: So mans heart by Gods Creation had all the Laws written in it, but after his Fall it was without any letter there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in effect, until that the Lord writ them anew.</item>
                        <item>6. At <hi>Moſes</hi> his return from the Lord with theſe Laws, his face did ſo ſhine, that the people were not able to look on him till he vail'd it; neither could the Jews, nor any of the Gentiles, be able to ſee into the end of the Law, Chriſt Jeſus, till the Lord took away their vail of blindeneſs and hardneſs of heart, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13, 14.</item>

                        <item>2.

                        <item>5. We muſt know, that the ſame vertue is often in a diverſe reſpect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in diverſe Commandments; that is, the ſame vertue is required for performing of obedience unto many Commandments.</item>
                        <item>6. In Affirmative Commandments commanding Vertues, are comprehended the Negative, forbidding the contrary Vices; ſo likewiſe in Negative Commandments are comprehended the Affirmative Vertues.</item>
                        <item>7. We muſt take heed that we reſtrain not the Commandments, and take them too ſtraitly; for in the General all the Specials, and in the chief Special, the next allyed Specials, and in the Effect the Cauſes be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: So that under one kinde manifeſt are all of like ſort, whether commanded or forbidden; yea, and the Means whereby the things are done, are alſo commanded or forbidden.</item>
                        <item>8. The Obedience or Commandments of the Second Table yield or give place to the Obedience or Commandments of the Firſt Table: The Commandments of the Firſt Table are abſolutely to be kept, and for themſelves, the other of the Second Table are to be kept for the Firſt: Though they are alike as concerning the kinde of Moral Worſhip, the kinde of puniſhment, and as concerning their coherence or connexion.</item>
                        <item>9. Every Negative Commandment doth binde always, and at, and unto all times: Every Affirmative Commandment doth onely binde always, but not at and unto all times alſo.</item>
                        <item>10. Howſoever the leaſt Commandment is not ſo ſmall, but the breach thereof deſerveth Eternal Death; yet the breaches of ſome Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are greater and more heinous then of others.</item>
                        <item>11. There is ſo near a relation betwixt all the Commandments of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law, that whoſoever obſerveth all ſaving onely in one point, is guilty of all, <hi>James</hi> 2.10. Becauſe one and the ſame is the Author of them all.</item>

                        </head>
                        <p>THerefore thou ſhalt have Me, that <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which have manifeſted my ſelf in the World by my Creation, Preſervation, and Government thereof; that <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which have declared my ſelf in my Church by the Participation and Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of my ſelf to be the true God, that God alone: Therefore <hi>Thou ſhalt have none other gods;</hi> that is, beſide me the onely true God: neither ſhalt thou have them before me; that is, in my ſight, that is, in thy heart or elſwhere. Now not to have the true God, is either to have no God, or to have more Gods, or another then the known God, or not to acknowledge God to be ſuch unto us as he is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted: Likewiſe not to truſt in God, and to ſubject and ſubmit our ſelves unto God in true humility and patience, not to hope for all good things from him alone, not to love and fear him, for we are here commanded to have the Lord for our God, that is, to love him above all, to fear him above all, to put our whole truſt in him, and to make our prayers to him alone: And he onely hath no other gods, who is ſo dead to the world, and doth ſo adhere to God, that he is neither puffed up with Riches, nor caſt down with Poverty; nor ſwelled with Honor, nor pined with Ignominy; nor made joyful by Life, nor afraid of Death: but this ſufficeth him, That he hath God, knowing his Savior diſdain'd both Riches, and Glory, and Pleaſure, and Life.</p>
                        <p>The Preface of this Commandment belongeth to the whole Decalogue; and the Commandment it ſelf is mixed with a Negative Prohibition and an Affirmative Command. The Duty enjoyn'd, is, To have and to ſet up in our hearts and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and him onely, for our God, which is the main and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſcope of the whole Law: And he that will abſtain from the breach of this Commandment, muſt not with the Atheiſt deny him that gave him Being, nor with the Ignorant neglect Divine Knowledge; nor with the Prophane be looſe-minded towards Gods Worſhip; nor with the Covetous Epicures, Self-lovers and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, rob God of his Honor. Now Atheiſm is a Monſter in Nature, whereby the Creature riſeth againſt the Creator, to diſannul him, to make him without Being, who giveth Being to all; to pull him out of the Throne of Heaven, whoſe Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool is the Earth; to put down his Power, who by his Power alone upholdeth all things: And this is when men do but in their hearts imagine that it is all vanity which is ſpoken of God, or that there is no ſuch God as the Word doth deſcribe unto us: And Ignorance is the next door to Atheiſm; for where Ignorance pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth, there can be but a poor deal of Love, little Confidence, and ſimple Service done unto the Lord: And Prophaneneſs is a Regardleſneſs of God, when a man being about any villany, remembreth not, or careth not that he is in Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, nor is daunted by any lets in the way; alſo a Regardleſneſs of the very Worſhip of God, when Prayer, the Word and Sacraments, is not uſed at all, or without all reverence; it maketh the perſons infected herewith, prefer any ſmall worldly thing, either of Pleaſure or Profit, before heavenly things. Laſtly, the Robbing of God of his Honor, is by Inward Idolatry, or of the heart, when Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are there ſet up, where onely is the room of the Creator: Now he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to keep this Commandment, muſt endeavor for the Vertues comprehended therein, and they are Knowledge of God, Truſt in God, Humility, Patience, Hope, The Love of God, and The Fear of God.</p>
                        <p>The Knowledge of God, is,
<note place="margin">Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</note> To judge of God as he hath manifeſted himſelf in his Word and Works, and to be moved up by that Knowledge to a Confidence,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:97622:100"/>Love, Fear, and Worſhip of the true God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3. This true Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God is the principal part and point of his Worſhip; and he may be known of reaſonable Creatures, ſo far forth as he will manifeſt himſelf to every one: which, if compared with that whereby God knoweth himſelf, is to be accounted unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; but, if the degrees thereof be conſidered in it ſelf, it is alſo either perfect or imperfect, yet not ſimply, but in compariſon, that is, in reſpect of the Superior and Inferior degree. The perfect Knowledge of God, is that in Creatures, wherein Angels and Men in the Celeſtial life know God by a moſt clear and bright beholding of the minde: The imperfect, is that whereby men in this life know God, though not ſo much as they could at firſt before the Fall by the benefit of their Creation. Now the ordinary means to know God, and which is preſcribed unto us by God himſelf, is by the ſtudy and meditation of heavenly Doctrine: wherefore we muſt ſtrive this way to know God, and not look for, from God, any extraordinary and immediate Illumination, except he of himſelf offer it, and confirm it alſo unto us by certain and evident Teſtimonies. And this Knowledge muſt be adorned with Practice, without which it is not indeed Knowledge: Whence poor Chriſtians are better taught then great learned men without grace; for no man knoweth more then he practiſeth, becauſe what knowledge ſoever a man hath that he practiſeth not, is but a dead knowledge, an inefficacious knowledge; and indeed, Religion is the Art of holy men, not of learned men: And as Knowledge thus without Practice ſavors of Hypocriſie; ſo Practice without Knowledge tends to Superſtition, the Mother whereof is Ignorance.</p>
                        <p>To Truſt in God,
<note place="margin">Faith.</note> is, To be unbottomed of thy ſelf and of every Creature, and ſo to lean upon God, that if he fail thee thou ſinkeſt: And God doth often defer deliverance till the utmoſt extremity, for the tryal of his peoples Faith, and to ſtrip them of other helps, that they may Truſt in him, for till then we truſt not in him as we ought. So that Gods people run another courſe from other men (though they have perſecution here for their pains) becauſe they truſt in the living God; And in a good Cauſe God hath promiſed good Succeſs, therein therefore we are to be guided with as much confidence of ſafety (while we Rule our ſelves therein ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods command) as if we had a Prophet immediately ſent us from God. Now the Reaſon why God is ready to help us, if we Truſt in him, is, Becauſe this our Faith in him is an Acknowledging of, and an Attributing to his Power; ſo that our Truſting in God engageth him to help us, though commonly he uſeth not to appear a Deliverer, till his people are brought to the very brink of Ruine.</p>
                        <p>Humility is a Vertue,
<note place="margin">Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> whereby one man thinks better of another then of himſelf, it makes a man vile in his own eyes; and this is one fruit of Faith: for where Chriſt comes to dwell, he comes with a Light, to make a man ſee his ſins, and what a creature he is: Therefore the Spirit of true Chriſtians, is a meek Spirit, they are humble, gentle, and little in their own eyes; they ſet not up Pride and Ambition, as other gods, in their hearts, but think baſely of themſelves, in regard of their own ſins and corruptions, and upon conſideration thereof, are content to give place unto others, and to yield of their own Right for the maintenance of Peace. This is that true Knowledge of a mans own ſelf, which indeed is Neceſſary for man to have, becauſe God will be known by his own Image, which he engraved in mans Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and without it we neither aſpire nor attain to that end, to which we were created.</p>
                        <p>Patience is the Knowledge and Acknowledgement of Gods Majeſty,
<note place="margin">Patience.</note> Wiſdom, Juſtice and Goodneſs, reſolving through a confidence in Gods Promiſes, and ſo in hope of Gods aſſiſtance and delivering, to obey God in ſuffering thoſe adverſities which he ſendeth us, and willeth us to ſuffer, neither in reſpect of the grief which they bring, to murmure againſt God, or to do any thing againſt his Commandments, but in the higheſt extremity to retain ſtill the confidence and hope of Gods aſſiſtance, and to ask deliverance of him; and by this Knowledge and full perſwaſion of Gods Will, to mitigate and aſſwage our grief. Thus Patience is a voluntary and continual
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:97622:100"/>ſuffering for the love of Vertue and Honeſty: Or, it is a Grace of the Spirit, flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Grace and Hope, whereby we ſuffer things that are evil, that we forſake not thoſe things which are good, by which we may attain to thoſe that are better. It is the Keeper of all the other Graces, for when we become impatient of any good quality, we preſently fall a committing the contrary Vice.</p>
                        <p>Hope is a ſure and certain expectation of Everlaſting Life,
<note place="margin">Hope.</note> freely to be given for Chriſts ſake, and of a mitigation or aſſwagement of preſent evils, and of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from the ſame evils of this life, and an expectation and looking for all Bleſſings neceſſary unto Salvation, according to the Counſel and Will of God: which Hope ſpringeth from Faith; for it is an expectation of ſuch good things to come as God hath promiſed and Faith believed. In expectation eſpecially conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the very nature of Hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24. If we hope, we wait: The proper object of Hope, conſiſteth in good things; herein it differeth from Fear. Theſe good things are not paſt nor preſent, but to come, neither are nor have been ſeen; for, <hi>Hope which is ſeen is no hope,</hi> Rom. 8.23. They are ſuch good things as God hath promiſed, for true Hope is termed <hi>The Hope of the Gospel, Col.</hi> 1.23. And ſuch as Faith believeth; for, <hi>Faith is the ground of things hoped for,</hi> Heb. 11.1. And, <hi>By Faith we wait,</hi> Gal. 5.5. Faith is the Mother, Hope the Daughter; Faith brings forth Hope, and Hope nouriſheth Faith: for except a man hopes and waits for that which he believes, his Faith will ſoon decay; and according to the quality and quantity of Faith, is the quality and quantity of Hope. Thus Hope diſtinguiſheth the Faith of Chriſtians from the Faith of Devils and Reprobates, and from Temporary Faith. A man hath never Faith to believe, but he hath Hope, which makes him expect what he believes; yet true Hope may be mingled with Fear: for if there be nothing but Hope, it is a ſign that Hope is not good. This lively Hope makes us labor for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of what we believe, it keeps our heads above the waves of Adverſity, without which, of all men a Chriſtian is moſt miſerable, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19. it being ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, for where no Hope is, there is no Faith: And as it is true, That no man can hope, except he firſt believe the Promiſes; ſo it is as true, That Faith is neceſſarily upheld and nouriſhed by Hope. Faith is Hopes Foundation, Hope Faiths Nouriſhment; Faith believes the Promiſes, Hope waits for the fulfilling of them; Faith believeth, and is perſwaded of life Eternal, Hope looketh when it ſhall be revealed: for this cauſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>We are ſaved by Hope, Rom.</hi> 8.24.</p>
                        <p>The Love of God is a holy Diſpoſition of the heart ariſing from Faith,
<note place="margin">Love.</note> whereby we cleave to the Lord, with a purpoſe of heart to ſerve him, and to pleaſe him in all things: which Love is ſo Neceſſary to Salvation, as he that hath it not, is in a curſed and damnable condition; he is not in Chriſt if he do not love, for there is a tye between all theſe, Faith, Repentance, Love, therefore they are uſed promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly: And indeed, if we Love not God, we rob him, for he bought us to be his; that is, to love him, otherwiſe we rob God of our ſelves. Now the way to Love God, is, To pray earneſtly, to acknowledge the power of the Holy Ghoſt; to go to him, and ſay, Lord, of my ſelf I am not able to do it: This acknowledgement of the power of the Holy Ghoſt, is the way to prevail; for unleſs the Holy Ghoſt kindle this fire of Love in us from Heaven, we ſhall no more have it then cold water is able to heat it ſelf: Though the Preachers ſpeak with the tongues of Angels, yet ſhall we not be brought to love the Lord till he ſhew himſelf to us, till he opens the cloud, and ſhews us the Light of his countenance. It was <hi>Moſes</hi> his Prayer, <hi>Shew me thy Glory;</hi> that is, thy Excellency, which is exceeding glorious: <hi>Moſes</hi> asked not this to no purpoſe, to ſatisfie his fancy, for then the Lord would not have heard him, but that by the better knowing the Lord, he might love him the more; for a principal means to the love of God, is the knowledge of God: and indeed, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we love him not, becauſe we know him not: This is the reaſon the Angels and the Saints love him moſt, becauſe they know him moſt; and why in heaven when we ſhall be preſent with him, ſhall we love him ſo abundantly, but becauſe we ſhall then know him face to face.</p>
                        <pb n="176" facs="tcp:97622:101"/>
                        <p>The Fear of God,
<note place="margin">Fear.</note> is To acknowledge the infinite Anger of God towards ſin, his great Power to puniſh ſin, his Wiſdom and Juſtice, and that Right and Dominion which he hath over all Creatures: which Fear is a great part of the Worſhip of God, and one infallible Sign of the true Religion; for that Religion is true, wherein God is truly worſhipped, and that is but one, and in it onely men ſhall be ſaved: Which true Chriſtian Religion, is a Spiritual Band, whereby men in a certain holy Reconciliation are made one with God, and are kept in his Love and Fear, that at length they may be made partakers of his heavenly Glory, and of bleſſed Life. And though all grant that to be the true Religion which hath been delivered by God himſelf, yet which may be that Religion delivered from above, will never be agreed on amongſt men, till our Lord Jeſus returning to Judgement decide the Controverſie.</p>
                        <p>Now we muſt not underſtand this Fear to be a ſervile Fear, ariſing from a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and an accuſing of ſin, and from a feeling of Gods Judgement and Anger againſt ſin, and is a ſhunning and hatred of God and Puniſhment, not of ſin; and is ſo much the greater, how much the more certain expectation there is of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Damnation, and how much the greater deſpair there is of the Grace and Mercy of God; But the Fear required in this Commandment, is a Filial Fear, ſuch as Sons bear towards their Parents, who are ſorry for the anger and diſpleaſure of their Father, and yet notwithſtanding are always perſwaded of the love and minde of their Father towards them. So that the Fear of God in the Regenerate in this life, is an acknowledging of ſin and the wrath of God, and an earneſt grief for the ſins committed, for the offending of God, and for thoſe calamities which by reaſon of ſin both we and others ſuſtain, with an earneſt deſire of avoiding thoſe evils by reaſon of the knowledge of that Mercy which is ſhewed unto us through Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28. Thus God alone is the proper object of Fear, for what fear is due to man, is due to him onely in and for the Lord, whoſe Image he beareth more eminently by vertue of ſome Authority or Dignity pertaining to him, which is to be feared: And the extent of this Filial Fear of God is ſo large, as without it other holy Duties cannot be well performed: yea, the whole Worſhip of God is often compriſed under it. Thus <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.10. Chriſt expreſſeth the Text, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. And thus <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.9. Chriſt expreſſeth the Text, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13.</p>
                        <p>The Vices contrary to the Vertues in general, contained in this Commandment, are chiefly theſe; <hi>viz.</hi> Atheiſm, Ignorance, Prophaneneſs, Inward Idolatry, Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt God, Doubting of his Promiſes, Deſperation, Impatience in Adverſity, Inconſtancy in Gods Worſhip and our own Vocations, Falling away from the Truth of the Goſpel, Raſhneſs, which adventureth upon unneceſſary dangers, under a colour of Gods Providence, Pride, Diſdain, Ambition, and Faint-heartedneſs in good things: All which are forbidden in this Commandment, yea all particular Vices ſpecially contrary to each Vertue commanded therein: The chief of both which are here again touched, in the ſame order they have been already glanc'd at: And firſt of Knowledge.</p>
                        <p>The Principal Vertue required in this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, which in particular hath four Branches:
<list>
                              <item>1. To know that there is a God; and this is known either by the book of Nature, The Works of God, or the book of Grace, Confeſſing it in our hearts by actions agreeable, as well as by language in our mouthes, elſe we ſin in Atheiſm.</item>
                              <item>2. To know the true God, elſe we ſin in Idolatry.</item>
                              <item>3. To know this true God is but one, elſe we ſin in Poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm.</item>
                              <item>4. To know of what nature this true onely God is, elſe we ſhall do nought but ſin.</item>

                              <item>2. Not ſimply and abſolutely perfect, whereby Angels and bleſſed men know indeed the whole and intire Nature and Majeſty of God, as being moſt ſimple; but they know it not wholly, that is, they ſo far onely underſtand it, as he revealeth it unto them, and their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are capable of.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>So likewiſe the Knowledge of God is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold:
<list>
                              <item>1. General, to know God to be ſuch an one as he hath revealed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his Word to be: without this we cannot be ſaved, yet this alone doth not ſave.</item>
                              <item>2. Particular, to know him to be ſuch an one to me in particular, as he hath revealed himſelf in his Word to be in general: This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth Faith.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>

                              <item>1. Literal, which hath been in men either from the Creation, or is wrought in their mindes of the Holy Ghoſt by the Word, which hath not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying it an endeavor and deſire of framing and conforming themſelves unto the Commandments of God. This is onely a Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative or Theoretical Knowledge, informing the judgement, but not reforming the minde; and this a wicked man may have in a greater meaſure then ſome Chriſtians, yet notwithſtanding may be damned: for this Knowledge is true onely in regard of the Object, but is falſe in regard of the Effect.</item>
                              <item>2. Spiritual, or true, lively and effectual Knowledge, which is kindled by the Holy Ghoſt in our mindes according to the Word and by the Word, working in the will and heart an inclination and deſire to know and do what God commandeth. This is Saving or Practical Knowledge, when the whole man is transformed into the obedience required, and labors to practice what he knows of God.</item>

                        <p>THe ſecond Duty required in this Commandment, is, To Truſt in the onely true God, and in him alone to put all truſt and confidence, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.8. This is Faith, by which whoſoever is united unto Chriſt, the ſame is Elected, Called, Juſtified, Sanctified, and ſhall be Glorified, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.36. &amp; 5.24. By this Faith is not meant an Hiſtorical Faith, as to know and think all thoſe things to be true which are mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted from above, either by Voyce or by Viſions, or by any other maner of Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and are taught in the Books of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and thus to be perſwaded of them for the aſſeveration and Teſtimony of God himſelf, firmly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting to the truth of thoſe things contained in the Scripture, for the Authority of God that ſpoke them: which Faith is good in it ſelf, but made ill, yea ſin by them that cannot apply it. Thus <hi>Simon Magus</hi> is ſaid to have believed, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.</p>
                        <p>By this Faith is not meant a Temporary Faith, as to aſſent unto the heavenly Doctrine which is delivered by the Prophets and Apoſtles, to profeſs it, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the knowledge thereof, and to glory therein for a time; yet not for any feeling of Gods grace towards them, but for other cauſes whatſoever, and therefore without any true Converſion, and final perſeverance in the Profeſſion of that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; for this kinde of Faith is led as in a ſtring with the commodities of this world, and with them doth live and dye. By this Faith is not meant the Faith of working Miracles, which is a ſpecial gift of working Miracles; that is, a certain perſwaſion ſpringing from an eſpecial Revelation and Promiſe of God, whereby a man firmly reſolveth, That ſome extraordinary or miraculous Work, and contrary to Nature, ſhall come to paſs by Gods Power, which he hath foretold, and would have to be done in the Name of God and Jeſus Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2. which Faith ſo flouriſhing in the Primitive Church, ceaſeth in thoſe days, for that the Doctrine is now ſufficiently confirmed, ſo ſufficiently indeed, as he that will not now believe without a Miracle, may ſtand for a Wonder himſelf. But by this Faith is meant
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:97622:103"/>Juſtifying Faith, wrought in the hearts of the Elect by the operation of Gods Spirit, grounded on Gods Promiſes, whereby we do undoubtedly believe that God hath freely forgiven us all our ſins, applying Chriſt Jeſus in particular to be our Savior and Redeemer. From this Faith Gods people can never finally and totally fall away; howſoever it may be ſometimes ſhaken, obſcured and eclipſed, ſo as it may not ſo manifeſtly appear at one time as at another; and this Faith is incident onely to the Elect, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. For it is a principal Grace of God, whereby man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted unto Chriſt, and thereby become one with Chriſt, and Chriſt one with him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.17. By this Faith in Chriſt, we are partakers of the Merit of the Death and Reſurrection of Chriſt, ſo as it is Satisfaction for us, and Forgiveneſs of all our ſins; a ſpecial grace or habit infuſed into the Soul by the Holy Ghoſt, whereby we are enabled to believe, not onely that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> is offered unto us, but alſo to take and receive him as a Lord and Savior.</p>
                        <p>Thus Juſtifying Faith cometh not, neither proceedeth or ariſeth out of the inſtinct of Nature, neither out of ſenſe or experience, neither out of Demonſtrations or Reaſons borrowed from Philoſophy but it cometh and dependeth of a peculiar and ſupernatural Revelation or Divine Teſtimony, it proceedeth from the Holy Ghoſt, who kindleth it in our hearts by the Preaching of the Goſpel, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it by the uſe of the Sacraments, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. Now we are not ſaid to be made Righteous through Faith onely, or that we pleaſe God through the worthineſs of meer Faith; but becauſe onely the Satisfaction, Righteouſneſs and Holineſs of Chriſt is our Righteouſneſs before God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. and we cannot take hold of it, or apply it to our ſelves, any other way then by Faith, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. Yet Faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Righteouſneſs is Preſumption, as Righteouſneſs without Truth is Hypocriſie. And thus Faith is as it were an Addition of a New Light to Reaſon, without which Reaſon is purblinde; and begins to breed in the heart, when the party begins to be touched in Conſcience for his ſins, and hungers withal and thirſts after Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs; the firſt act of the underſtanding being to aſſent to the Truth contained in the Promiſes, wherein Chriſt is offered, and then the act of the Will to conſent unto them, that is, to embrace them. But before a man will be willing to take Chriſt, the heart muſt be changed by God, for none will take Chriſt upon Chriſts conditions, till they be throughly humbled, and have their hearts broken, that know what the wrath of God is, and have their Conſciences awakened to ſee ſin, till they have been ſtung with a ſenſe of their ſins, till they be heavy, and have felt the weight of Satans yoke, till then they will not come under the yoke of Chriſt, and then they will come in, and be glad they have Chriſt, though on Chriſts conditions. Thus as the children of Iſrael being ſtung with fiery Serpents, and that unto death, were healed by looking unto the brazen Serpent erected by <hi>Moſes;</hi> ſo when we are ſtung by the old Serpent, Sin and Death, we muſt ever remember by Faith to look upon Chriſt. Now we are ſaid to <hi>Take Chriſt,</hi> when we ſo take him, as to bring him into our hearts to dwell there, when we are knit to him and he to us: But ſome men cleave to Chriſt, not becauſe they have any good ground, but becauſe they want Temptations to a contrary way; therefore it is Gods uſual maner when men ſeem to Take Chriſt, and to believe in him, to put them to the tryal, to ſee what they will do, whether their Faith will work or no: For when to ſuch as take Chriſt for love of the good things by him, and not for love of his perſon, other commodities are preſented, that are preſent and ſenſible, and in their apprehenſion greater then thoſe by Chriſt, then they let Chriſt go again, and their Faith proves uneffectual; like thoſe that marry not for Love, but for Wealth; the maner of theſe men is to ſeek mercy and not grace: yet may we look upon our own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages by Chriſt, but not on that alone. Thus when a man is drawn from God, it is either by ſome offer of ſome great benefit or ſome great evil which he is put in fear of; in both which Faith is that <hi>
                              <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num Neceſſarium</hi> to keep thee from ſinning, for it is Faiths office to guide our lives, ſo as that we be not overcome by Adverſity, nor drawn aſide from God in Proſperity.</p>
                        <pb n="181" facs="tcp:97622:103"/>
                        <p>Now that Faith that ſaves, muſt be effectual Faith, it is the effectualneſs of Faith onely that God requires; that is, if there be any effectualneſs in man that comes not from Faith, God requires it not, but if we labor to grow in Faith, we ſhall be enabled to do the duties of New Obedience; but if we have not the ground, all that we do is but in vain: Therefore when we finde any coldneſs, weakneſs or languiſhing in the Graces we have, encreaſe Faith, and all other Graces will grow. This effectual Faith is wrought, or our Faith is made effectual by the Spirit of God, it is not in our own power, of our ſelves we are not able to believe; if God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf put not his hand to the work, no man is able to believe, becauſe naturally man hath a hard heart. So for an holy life, when we have believed and accepted the Righteouſneſs that is offered us in Chriſt, when that is done, it is Gods part to frame and fit us for an holy life: for after that a man is Juſtified by Faith, Chriſt Sanctifieth him, and it is he that carries him afterward thorough his whole life in a holy converſation. And as Chriſt is thus made unto us Juſtification and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo is he made unto us Redemption alſo; for he delivers us from the leaſt evils as well as from Death Eternal, and Hell it ſelf: yea, there is no evil that the Saints are freed from, but it is purchaſed by the Blood of Chriſt, which is over and above ſome general works of Gods Providence that all men taſte of. Now though there be ſufficiency in Chriſt to ſave all, yet none have benefit by it, but thoſe that receive it as they ought, that is, as a Lord as well as a Savior: We muſt therefore come to God as with a full heart, ſo with an empty hand, for Faith doth its work beſt alone; for all that Faith hath to do, is onely to Take from Chriſt that Righteouſneſs which we want our ſelves: And without this Faith, God regards not the beſt Moral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues; the Moral man, what he doth, he doth it of himſelf, and through himſelf, and for himſelf; but he that doth what he doth by Faith, doth it of Chriſt, and through Chriſt, and for Chriſt: for we muſt receive all from Chriſt, and do all for Chriſt, and all by Faith. Faith worketh in us a love to God, and preſenteth to him a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Righteouſneſs; and this Faith is the ſum of the Preaching of Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles. Now God requires no more but a Willingneſs in Earneſt to come and take Chriſt, he will make thee able afterward to do the reſt, for God never gives his Son to any, but he gives them the Holy Ghoſt, the Spirit of his Son, alſo.</p>
                        <p>And we muſt know, That Faith admits degrees, and that every Chriſtian ought to grow from degree to degree, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.17. for though the weakeſt Faith may be a true, and ſo a Saving Faith, yet if this ſmall meaſure of Faith be not edged on with a longing fervency after fulneſs of perſwaſion, and ſeconded with an aſſiduous ſerious endeavor after more perfection, it is no ſound and ſaving Faith, but onely a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit ſhew or deceiving ſhadow. The leaſt Aſſent to, the leaſt Belief of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, ſo it be ſufficient to over-ballance the Scale of Doubting (which is called the leaſt degree of Faith) brings us to Chriſt, and make us willing to Take him, and is Faith, though it come not to the full degree, though it hath ſome doubting, ſome fears: And afterward we ſhall be more fully and better perſwaded, which addes to the degrees. For Faith, though it be mingled with ſome doubtings and fears, may be effectual, though not perfect, for there is a Doubting mingled with the beſt Faith; ſo it be but ſuch a Doubting as does not overcome, it may ſtand with true and ſound Faith. If a man hath ſo taken Chriſt, that ſtill he is growing, ſtill his Faith is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing, ſtill overcoming theſe doubts and fears from day to day, he is better and better reſolved, if it be thus ſtill on the growing hand, it is a ſaving and effectual Faith; yea, it is not Faith except it hath ſome Doubting, except there be ſome fears, ſome troubles within, that reſiſt this Faith, and ſtrive againſt it; for there is no man that hath perfect Faith, eſpecially at the firſt, or afterward, ſo as to ſet his heart fully at peace. So that it is ſaid of Doubting, in this caſe, as we ſay of Thiſtles, They are ill Weeds, but it is a ſign the ground is fat and good where they grow: So Doubting, as it is a thing that reſiſts Faith, is bad, but it is a ſign the heart is good where it is; ſo that where there is no Queſtioning, there is all Fleſh. And a man may have a ſaving Faith, though he want the comfortable Aſſurance thereof in his
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:97622:104"/>own knowledge, which is the reflect act of Faith: For as ſome men have a perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the forgiveneſs of their ſins, yet not ſavingly believe; ſo a true Believer may have but a weak perſwaſion of the forgiveneſs of his ſins, but that Faith which is joyned with Love, is infallibly true, but disjoyned thence, is falſe; and the ſmalleſt Faith, yea the weakeſt, may yet be a ſound, true and ſaving Faith; it is not the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of degrees and meaſure that takes away the nature of it: For Faith, in regard of the extent of it, admits degrees, not becauſe the Habit is encreaſed, but becauſe the Revelations and Objects are more; and therefore thoſe poor Chriſtians that are yet ignorant, may have a true habit, and as true a Grace in the heart: And though a man be more converſant in the Scripture, knows more then they, hath more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, and in that ſenſe though he hath a greater Faith then the other, yet the other hath a like precious Faith with him in regard of that Grace. Nor do Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities break the Covenant betwixt God and thoſe that have once taken Chriſt, and have true Faith, though in the leaſt degree. Now in Taking Chriſt, the ſtronger the Will is, by how much ſtronger Aſſent the Minde and Underſtanding gives to thoſe Truths which concern Juſtification delivered in the Scripture: And we muſt labor to believe hard things, like <hi>Abraham;</hi> or eaſie things propounded with ſlender Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, like <hi>Nathaniel:</hi> for if we believe in difficult caſes, God will make us with facility to believe them another time: We muſt labor for the extent of Faith, for the multitude of Revelations, to be filled full of Faith, as <hi>Barnabas</hi> is ſaid to be, and this is by ſtudying the Word much, for therein will God reveal this.</p>
                        <p>This Faith is the Mother of all Sanctifying Graces, for by it we are ingrafted into Chriſt, and ſo live the life of Faith, the life of God; the fruits of Faith are almoſt infinite, for all the ſeveral and diſtinct branches of Piety and Charity, if they be rightly performed, are fruits of Faith: And where there is a true Faith, there is a ſecret perſwaſion wrought in the heart, whereby God aſſures us that he is ours and we are his; for we may know, and be aſſured that Chriſt dyed for us, and Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us in particular, if we can finde in our ſelves that we have true Faith in Chriſt, and true Repentance for all ſins: And we may be aſſured of our Vocation, if through the Myſtery of the Word, ſeconded and made powerful by Gods Spirit, we are quite altered and changed from our former evil lives, and have attained unto Faith and Repentance. And we may be further aſſured, That we are Redeemed, and are the children of God, if we finde that we have the Spirit of God dwelling in us, which if we want, we are none of Gods; which if we have, it will appear by the fruits of the Spirit in us: for as Exerciſe begets Health, and we are made fit by Health for Exerciſe; or as Acts beget Habits, and Habits are means to exerciſe thoſe Acts: ſo Aſſurance grounded upon the Promiſe, enableth, enlargeth and encreaſeth Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Sanctification encreaſeth Aſſurance; but firſt ſee Faith, and then the other as fruits of it. Now Faith is wrought in us thus; The Spirit comes and ſhews Chriſt to us, and not onely the profit we have by him, but the beauty and excellency of him: it ſhews us what Grace is, and makes us love it, and then ſhews us Mercy: Out of this we come to long after Chriſt, and to ſay, I would I had him. Now to this work he addes a ſecond; Chriſt comes and tells a man, I will have thee, he comes and ſhews himſelf, diſcovers himſelf, and ſpeaks plainly to him, I am willing to marry thee: Now the longing Soul hearing thoſe glad tidings, embraces the motion, and the work is done. We may know whether this Faith be wrought in us, by reflecting upon our own hearts, and conſidering what actions have paſſed through it; for the works of Faith are manifeſt: And we muſt uſe Faith in comforting our ſelves, for whatſoever Chriſt hath by Nature, we have it by Grace, when we have Faith: if he be a Son, we are Sons: if he be an Heir, we are Heirs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yea, Faith makes a man regardleſs of all earthly things.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe that have Faith, are able to uſe it of themſelves; but many have it that do not uſe it: and though God doth work in us all the work of Faith as it is received, yet know, He doth not work in us onely, but by us, he makes us Inſtruments: yea, we ſhall be called to an account for the Talent of Faith, if we have it and uſe it not:
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:97622:104"/>and if we uſe it not, we ſhall have little enough o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> it, for the uſing of it is that which ſtrengthneth Faith, and makes it effectual. Now that we are ſaved by Faith, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from theſe places of Scripture, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. &amp; 3.28. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.7, 9. <hi>Luke</hi> 7.50. Yet know, That a man is not ſaved by Faith ſimply as it is Faith, for it doth not in its own nature merit Salvation, but it is ſaid to ſave us in reſpect of its Object, which is Chriſt; not as it is a gift, quality or property, but as it is an Inſtrument to apprehend and apply this Object, ſo that we are ſaved by Faith as an Inſtrument, not for Faith as a Cauſe: So Faith alone is ſaid to juſtifie us, but that Faith which is alone, without other Graces, doth not juſtifie us; neither were ever any juſtified by Faith without Works. For Faith is not onely a Perſwaſion that our ſins are forgiven, but alſo a thorough Repenting that our ſins may be forgiven; not onely a Perſwaſion that the Promiſes are true, but a Holineſs of living, that we may have a ſhare in thoſe Promiſes; not onely a Perſwaſion that the Scripture is true, but an Obedience to Gods Will revealed therein; not onely a Perſwaſion that Chriſt dyed for my ſins, but alſo ſuch an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs of walking, as that I crucifie him not again by my Luſts: for Faith doth not onely work a good meaning in us, but it doth work power in us to do good, and to mortifie our affections; for where Chriſt dwells indeed, he gives power againſt ſin, and that by his Spirit; and where the Underſtanding is fully convinced, the Will and Affections follow: Faith, and the Deſire of ſatisfying Luſts, cannot ſtand together; and he that truſts not God for Earthly things, cannot truſt him for matters of Salvation: for, if we have Faith in the main, we will have it in particular caſes.</p>

                        <head>§. 3. <hi>Of Humility.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>HUmiliation is the fruit of Faith, and the firſt effect whereby Faith, which lies hid in the heart, doth appear: And in the very inſtant, when a ſinner begins truly in heart and conſcience to humble himſelf before God, he is then entred into the ſtate of Salvation. Now if a man finde himſelf hard-hearted, and of a dead Spirit, ſo as he cannot humble himſelf as he ought or as he would, ſuch perſons, if they humble themſelves, muſt be content with that Grace which they have received; for if thou be truly and unfainedly grieved for this, That thou canſt not be grieved, thy Humiliation will be accepted: And though it may be thou art more humbled, and haſt a greater grief for an earthly loſs then for thy committed ſins, yet mayeſt thou even then be truly humbled and grieved for thy ſins too; becauſe the one is a bodily, natural and ſenſible loſs, and the other a ſupernatural, inſenſible and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual: Now ſenſible things do more affect and urge the minde then the other. The heart of man cannot be lifted up in Aſſurance of Gods favor, to the apprehenſion of heavenly things, unleſs it be firſt abaſed by true Humiliation, brought to nothing in it ſelf. To this muſt be added Faith; for in the practice of a Chriſtian life, the duties of Humiliation and Faith cannot be ſevered: Till the heart be throughly by Humiliation prepared, by being broken with the ſight of ſins and Gods wrath, Chriſt and the Goſpel is preached to it in vain; and though ſome drink in the Truth of the Goſpel with their Education, yet ſuch uſually hold not out without alſo ſound Humiliation. Thus by the Spirit of <hi>Elias,</hi> is meant a ſharp Miniſtery, to ſhew men their ſins, that they may be throughly humbled and prepared; elſe they will never take Chriſt ſo as to keep cloſe to him, for without ſound Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:97622:110"/>ſin is not accounted the greateſt evil, nor Chriſt the greateſt good: We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love Chriſt, till upon the conſideration of our ſins, we are humbled for them, and are become poor in Spirit, and then the Lord regards us highly, and will raiſe us up; but the want of ſorrow for ſin, is a greater Argument of the want of love to Chriſt, then the ſin it ſelf.</p>
                        <p>Now Humiliation is not required as a Qualification, antecedent and precedent to the pardon of our ſins, for no Tears of ours can give Satisfaction; beſide, <hi>Judas</hi> the Reprobate had it: but it is required as that, without which we will not come to Chriſt. Now the taking of Chriſt, is nothing elſe but what we call Faith, and Faith is nothing elſe, but when theſe two things concur, That God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will give his Son, and freely offers Righteouſneſs, and we receive this Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, taking Chriſt for our Husband, our King and our Lord. And when we are truly entred into the ſtate of this Humiliation, we ſhall not fail of that Humility required in this Commandment; for we ſhall then acknowledge all thoſe good things which are in us, and done by us, not to come from any worthineſs or abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of our own, but from the free goodneſs of God: we ſhall then by the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging of Gods Divine Majeſty, and our infirmity and unworthineſs, ſubject and ſubmit our ſelves unto God, to give the glory of all good things, which are in us, to him alone: We ſhall then truly fear God, We ſhall then acknowledge and bewail our own defects and vices: we ſhall not then covet any higher place or condition: we ſhall not then truſt in our own gifts, but in the help and aſſiſtance of God: we ſhall then hold our ſelves contented with our own Vocation and Calling: we ſhall not then deſpiſe others in compariſon of our ſelves, neither let or hinder them in the diſcharging of their duty, but acknowledge that others alſo are and may be made profitable Inſtruments of Gods glory, and therefore give place and honor to them: we ſhall not then attribute to our ſelves things above our force and power: we ſhall not then affect any one excellency above others: neither ſhall we then murmure againſt God, if we fail of our hope, or if we be deſpiſed, but in all things aſcribe the praiſe of Wiſdom and Juſtice unto God. Let no man therefore preſume above that which is written: <hi>For who hath ſeparated thee? or what haſt thou that thou haſt not received?</hi> 1 Cor. 4.6. <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.5. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall humble himſelf as this little childe, the ſame is the greateſt in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 18.4. And this is that Humility required in this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and him in whom it is, the Lord will exalt in due time, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5.</p>

                              <item>2. A feigned Modeſty or Humility, which is a double Pride; and it is, to hunt after the praiſe and commendation of Humility, by denying of thoſe things outwardly, which yet a man doth in his minde attribute unto himſelf, either truly or falſely, and by refuſing of that honor which he deſireth above the peace of a good Conſcience, and covertly laboreth to compaſs.</item>

                        <head>§. 4. <hi>Of Patience.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>PAtience is the knowledge and acknowledging of Gods Majeſty, Wiſdom, Juſtice, Power and Goodneſs, reſolving through a confidence in Gods Promiſes, and ſo in hope of Gods aſſiſtance and deliverance, to obey God in ſuffering thoſe evils and afflictions which he ſendeth on us, and willeth us to ſuffer, and herein not to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure againſt God, or do any thing againſt his Commandments, but by this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and full perſwaſion of Gods good will and pleaſure herein, To comfort our ſelves in our diſtreſs, and to Pray in Faith, and Wait in Hope for his deliverance. Humility and Patience belong unto this firſt Commandment, not onely becauſe they are parts of that internal obedience which God requireth immediately to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed unto him; but alſo becauſe they follow and accompany the true Knowledge, Confidence, Love, and Fear of God, as neceſſary effects of the ſame: For in caſes of Diſtreſs, of Perſecution and Affliction, we muſt not live by feeling, but by Faith, for Afflictions are Pledges and Tokens of our Adoption, if we make the right uſe of them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.7. And when God defers deliverance, he doth it upon great and weighty cauſes and conſiderations beſt known unto himſelf; for in his Wiſdom he hath ſet down certain and unchangeable Times for the accompliſhment and iſſue of all things that are: And indeed there is a neceſſity of having this godly vertue of Patience, for we need many afflictions, becauſe the corruptions of the heart are of diverſe ſorts, and we need long afflictions, becauſe ſin is very natural, yet there may be good in that evil we ſuffer, and in the worſt dangers there is ſomewhat that makes the godly truſt in God, that keeps them up from ſinking. A ſound Spirit will bear any Affliction, and therein is a Chriſtian happy, for God loves us tenderly in Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: whence the difference between the Saints and others in the ſame Afflictions, is, That though the ſame Afflictions befal both, yet God hath reſpect to his in it, not to the others, <hi>Jer.</hi> 24. The wicked, though proſpering, yet ſtand in ſlippery places; the godly, though afflicted, are built on the Rock Chriſt. To proſper in ſin, is the miſerableſt condition in the world, for when the wicked are not interrupted in their courſe, God hath a purpoſe to deſtroy them, as <hi>Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phineas:</hi> Proſperity hurts evil men, yea, and as much as Affliction doth good to the godly. Evil men may proſper, and good men be croſſed many times, not proſpering in their buſineſs, and that in thoſe things which they do according to Gods Will, as in the ſucceſs of <hi>Pauls</hi> Miniſtery at <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and the Diſciples jeopardy on the water, though they were there on Chriſts command.</p>
                        <p>Thus the Lord dealeth promiſcuouſly with good and bad in outward things, that we may not know where to have him in his ways and actions, which are paſt finding out: therefore we muſt not judge by Gods outward proceeding, till he hath finiſhed the work, nor murmure at his Providence, or prove impatient under the ſmart of any Affliction whatſoever: For the Afflictions of the godly are not puniſhments, and ſatisfaction for their ſins, but onely fatherly chaſtiſements, and the Croſs, whereby they are brought to Humility. To the wicked they are indeed a puniſhment, which is either Deſtruction or Torment, inflicted by the order of Juſtice on the perſon guilty of ſin: And this is proper unto the Reprobate, becauſe it is inflicted on them to this end, That Gods Juſtice may be ſatisfied: for the Law bindeth all men either to Obedience or to Puniſhment. Now the wicked deſpairing of the Mercy of God, murmure at his Juſtice, and are even mad with impatience, when his inflicting Scourge is on them: but the godly kiſs his Rod, and <hi>in patience poſſeſs their Souls,</hi> reſting on the Promiſes of God. This is that which ſets them at liberty in the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, makes them run the paths of Gods Commandments even when Irons manacle them, makes them go chearfully to the Faggot, and embrace the Flame, makes them ſmile at the frowns of their Perſecutors, and in an holy patience makes them as it were anticipate Death, by dying to all impatience, that when it comes indeed, they
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:97622:111"/>may be ſaid rather to be changed, then dye. And indeed, this one Conſideration, How that thoſe that perſecute the Saints here, would undoubtedly perſecute Chriſt himſelf, were he now upon Earth, is ſufficient of it ſelf to ſupport the Spirits of any that now are or may be under Perſecution; beſide the conſideration that God will as undoubtedly deliver his to his glory and their advantage, as he permits Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution to befal them.</p>

                              <item>2. This meditation muſt enter into our Souls, and never depart from us, that God will turn all our ſorrows and ſufferings unto the beſt, and that every Affliction upon the Servants of God, hath ſome ſpecial goodneſs in it.</item>

                              <item>4. We are made to ſuffer here, that we might not ſuffer elſwhere.</item>
                              <item>5. It is the Will of God that we ſhould ſuffer, to which we muſt willingly obey, and humbly ſubmit our ſelves, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29.

                              <item>6. We muſt conſider that the party diſtreſſed hath partners in the Croſs, That God will aſſiſt us in the patient bearing of them, That God promiſeth a bleſſed iſſue, That by means of them Proſperity is made more pleaſant and delectable.</item>
                              <item>7.

                              <item>3. Too light regard of Croſſes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.11. So ſome deſpiſe them as matters not much to be regarded, not looking to God who ſmiteth.

                              <item>4. Too great fear of ſuch Croſſes as God layeth on men, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.5.

                        </head>
                        <p>HOpe is an infallible and moſt comfortable expectation of all the Promiſes made by God unto the Faithful for Chriſts ſake, and ſo of an allaiment of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent afflictions, and of a final deliverance from the ſame; and laſtly, an earneſt looking for all thoſe bleſſings neceſſary to ſalvation, according to the good will and pleaſure of God. This Hope ſpringeth from Faith, for he that is certain of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent will of God towards him, that is aſſured of his grace and favor, hath alſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and aſſured promiſes of the time to come; For God is unchangeable, yea, and the gifts and calling of God are without repentance. Now when we believe on true, ſound, and undeceiveable grounds that Chriſt is ours, that heaven is ours, that our ſins are pardoned, and that we are the Adopted ſons of God; then comes in Hope, and that paſſionately expecteth that which is to come; yea, though Perſecution, Fire, Sword, Famine, Peſtilence, Bondage, and thouſands of other croſſes and calamities involve us to eclipſe our Faith, this Hope holds us above the Waves, makes us danger-proof, roots us unanchorable, and at length brings us ſafe to our expected haven.</p>

In regard of the time which God hath ſet down for the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Promiſes, which time is oft both unknown and long dated; though the time be of God certainly determined; ſo as it cannot be prevented, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.30. nor ſhall be over-paſſed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. yet it is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made known unto us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.32. <hi>Acts</hi> 1.7.</item>
                              <item>2. In regard of thoſe many troubles and perplexities which do fall out betwixt the making and accompliſhing of Gods Promiſes. <hi>Iſrael</hi> may be a ſad witneſs hereof, ere they enjoyed the promiſed <hi>Canaan.</hi>

                              <item>4. In regard of our own weakneſs: for we are very prone by Nature to think, That God remembers not his Promiſes, eſpecially if he delay their accompliſhment, or bring us to any ſtraights, and ſeem to hide his face.</item>

                              <item>3. That he ſhall not loſe his labor if he do attempt it: Now Faith onely applies the Promiſes with boldneſs; but we are not affected with Spiritual Priviledges, becauſe we look on them with a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral eye, as matters of fancy and ſpeculation, becauſe we ſee no ſuch thing, we have no feeling of them. And the Promiſes of God are always to be underſtood with an Exception of the Croſs of the godly, and of the puniſhments and chaſtiſements of ſuch as depart from God and Sin, or with a condition of perſeverance in Faith and godlineſs.</item>

<list>
                              <item>1. Secret; that is, the Secret Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that God gives to every mans heart, as a Privy-Seal that God ſets on it.</item>

                              <item>3. In their Nature: Faith believeth the very Truth of Gods Promiſes, and ſealeth that God is true; Hope waiteth till God manifeſt and accompliſh his Truth.</item>

                        </head>
                        <p>THe Love of God is a moſt upright affection of the Minde, by which God is loved for himſelf, and our Neighbor for God: which Love is grounded on Gods love to us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.19. Indeed Love is nothing elſe but a diſpoſition of the Will, whereby it cleaves or makes forward to ſome good that is agreeable to it ſelf; yea, all the Affections are nothing elſe but the diverſe motions and turnings of the Will. Now Love is that act of the Will, whereby it turns it ſelf to a thing; as Hatred is that whereby it turns it ſelf from a thing: And the object of Love is ſomewhat that is good, not that is True, or that is Beautiful, for this is onely the object of the intuitive underſtanding: So that to love the Lord, is not onely required, That we be perſwaded that he is well-affected to us, That he is willing to receive us, but alſo that we look on him as one that is ſuitable and agreeable to us: And indeed, that is the main, the other will follow eaſily. Hence men may have a perſwaſion of their ſins forgiveneſs, and yet want true Faith, for that which begets not Love is not Faith: Now a man may have that perſwaſion of Chriſt, yet not love Chriſt (as a Priſoner may of the Judge, yet not love the Judge) for love comes from ſome ſuitableneſs, ſome agreeableneſs between the parties: but when a man is humbled, and looks on Chriſt, and again is perſwaded that Chriſt looks on him, and that Chriſt will take him; when this is done, then a man receives Chriſt by Faith, and from this Faith iſſues this Love.</p>
                        <p>Theſe two great radical Vertues, Faith and Love, are the two Pillars, as it were, upon which the Fabrick of our Salvation is built: for nothing makes us the Sons of God, but ſuch Faith as is accompanied with Love and good Works: It is Gods pleaſure to ſave us in this maner, that it may be of grace. To love any man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is a Chriſtian and a childe of God, is a ſenſible and certain note that he is partaker of the true Love of God in Chriſt: And it is much eaſier to love Holineſs in the Saints then in God himſelf, becauſe he is far remote from us, and they amongſt us are viſibly ſeen; therefore unleſs we finde our hearts inwardly moved to love them, yea with a natural affection as it were, we but pretend to love God. Love is a commanding Affection, yea Love and Hatred are as it were the great Lords and Maſters that divide the Affections between them. Now the Reaſon why we hate God naturally, is by reaſon of that oppoſition and contrariety which is between God and every Man by Nature: for all Love comes from ſimilitude and agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; therefore this ſinful Nature of ours muſt be broken in pieces and ſubdued,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:97622:117"/>again new-molded and framed, before it can ever be fit to love God. Hence it is that any natural man that hath the moſt impure heart, may, to eſcape Hell and get Heaven, do all the works the Papiſts require, and for the ſame end that they require them, but to do it out of love to God, that is a thing no Hypocrite can reach to; and therefore the giving a cup of cold water proceeding from Love, is a better work then a Martyrdom, the giving ones body to be burned, and all that he hath to feed the poor, if it come not from Love; yea, then all this coming not from Love, is to God more acceptable, the very will of doing the leaſt good, though the deed be never done, ſo the Will ariſe from this affection of Love: But when a man loves not, he breaks the whole Law; for as Love is the keeping of the whole Law, ſo the want of Love is the breach of the whole Law.</p>
                        <p>Now true love looks firſt to Chriſts perſon, next to the Promiſes and benefits we have by him: And this love to God doth not ſo reſtrain us, but we may love the Creature alſo; yet ſo, that if this Love to the Creature doth over-ballance, or any away leſſen our love to God by the inordinateneſs of it to the Creature, then is it an adulterous love: Nor doth it reſtrain our liberty, for he that gives his heart to God, hath as much liberty as he that followeth his luſts; all the difference is, the one is an unjuſt owner, the other the Lord hath made the ſteward of his own heart, ſo that he hath it as before, onely now he doth uſe it at Gods appointment, before it was at his own.</p>
                        <p>What it is to love God:
<list>
                              <item>1. To acknowledge God to be exceeding good, bountiful and merciful, not onely in himſelf, but alſo in us and towards us, and that therefore he doth imploy his Power, Wiſdom, Juſtice, Mercy and Goodneſs to our Salvation, and ſo through the acknowledging of this his infinite goodneſs towards us to love God, as that we more covet and deſire our conjoyning and conformity with him, and the execution of his Will, then all other things whatſoever.</item>
                              <item>2. To leave and relinquiſh all things, rather then to be bereaved of his communion and fellowſhip, or to offend him in any thing; and to be ready to part with all other things which we love, for his ſake, and to care for nothing more then how we may do things acceptable and grateful to him.</item>

                                    <item>1. It will not limit it ſelf in Duties.</item>

                        <p>THe laſt Vertue required in this Firſt Commandment, is the Fear of God; which being formerly touch'd, and though taken in a ſtrict conſideration, was yet found to be a great part of the Worſhip of God, and an infallible Sign of the true Religion: We ſhall therefore in this place ſpeak a word more of it, onely in reference thereto. Now whereas it is ſaid to be a great part of the Worſhip of God, it is underſtood chiefly and principally of the Inward Worſhip, which alone is properly, ſimply, and of it ſelf the Worſhip of God; the Outward is not ſimply the Worſhip of God, but onely ſo far forth as it is quickned by the Inward, and grounded on it. God is a Spirit, his Worſhip is Spiritual. This is the Worſhip of the Minde, the Heart, the Conſcience, the Will and Affections: for Man by all theſe joyntly and ſeverally performeth Worſhip and Service to his Creator; and this is the Spiritual Worſhip of the Inward Man, the Foundation of all true Worſhip of God: whereas the Outward Worſhip is onely that, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Inward is teſtified outwardly by the ſpeech and actions. The Worſhip of God, according to his Word, conſiſteth in things which God either giveth us, as his Titles and Works; or requireth of us, as Hearing his Word, Prayer, Sacraments, Vows and Swearing, in all which <hi>thou ſhalt fear the Lord thy God, becauſe he is the Lord,</hi> Levit. 14.19. To which may be added Outward Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Confeſſion (not ordinary or Eccleſiaſtical Confeſſion, but ſuch as is made before the Adverſary) and Faſting; in all which the Fear of God, which is taken for the whole Worſhip of God, or for the general Obedience, according to all Gods Commandments, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.7. This Fear, which ariſeth from a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Gods Juſtice, and of his Power to puniſh ſins, from a conſideration of of that Right and Dominion which he hath over all Creatures. This Fear, which is an acknowledging of ſin and the wrath of God, keeps the whole Man in a Religious Reſpect, a holy Dreadfulneſs, and in an awful Reverence of the great and mighty Majeſty of Heaven and Earth, commands him to walk as in the Preſence of God, that even his whole Converſation ſeems one undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued, holy, and Religious Adoration.</p>

                        <head>§. 8. <hi>Of Ignorance.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>HAving ſpoken of the Vertues required in this Commandment, we come now to the Vices therein forbidden; but becauſe they are many (as may formerly appear in the firſt Paragraph of this Chapter) and this Book no Forreſt but an <hi>Arbor,</hi> we ſhall touch, and but touch onely three of the chiefeſt of them; <hi>viz.</hi> Ignorance, Deſperation and Pride. Ignorance, or not knowing of the true God and his Will, is, Not to know thoſe things of God, or to doubt of them, which we ought to know by the benefit of our Creation, and by his Manifeſtations. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we muſt not, neither can we poſſibly know God as he is in himſelf, for ſo he is Infinite, and therefore Incomprehenſible in regard of us; but we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, ſo as he doth reveal himſelf to us in his Creatures, principally in his Word.</p>
                        <p>Now as Ignorance is in it ſelf a ſin and a cauſe of ſin; ſo is it in it ſelf the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of ſin and a cauſe of the puniſhment. This Ignorance is called, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.6. <hi>The Mother of Deſtruction,</hi> though the blinde Papiſts proclaim her <hi>The Mother of Devotion:</hi> From this ſin of Ignorance they derive their Devotion, or their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, or which is worſe, their Idolatry: They ſay Ignorance is <hi>The Mother of Devotion,</hi> the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>of Idolatry, Gal.</hi> 4.8. which ſpeaks Truth, judge. The Papiſts hoodwink the poor people, and tell them the knowledge of the Scriptures will cauſe them to erre. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Ye erre not knowing the Scriptures,</hi> Mat. 21.19. which ſpeaks Truth, judge. Upon Ignorance of the Scriptures, muſt needs follow Ignorance of Chriſt, for <hi>they are they that teſtifie of Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 5.39. Now Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance being in it ſelf a moſt odious Vice, againſt which <hi>Chriſt will come in flaming fire to render vengeance,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.8. and a Mother ſin of many other notorious ones, it is as ſtrange to us as true in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> how any man that hath but the light of Nature ſhould be ſo blinde, as to imagine the leaſt light can come out of darkneſs; yea, when the Devil the Prince of Darkneſs is ſaid to be the God of them that are blinded, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.4. Thus are they pitifully beguiled, that think the Scriptures, being a two-edged Sword, is too ſharp and keen for Lay men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ſuch as have not skill in Tongues and Arts, and therefore the knowledge thereof very dangerous for them, in caſe they ſhould pierce and wound their own Souls and Conſciences with this Sword, as children hurt themſelves with Knives; but in a ſecure and quiet Ignorance they may go to Hell unmoleſtedly, without the leaſt check or trouble of Conſcience.</p>
                        <p>Blinde Souls! not knowing that the Word of God, as it is ſharp in it ſelf, ſo hath an inward power to give ſharpneſs of wit, and that unto the ſimple, and to the childe knowledge and diſcretion, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.4. ſo as by the Word they may learn how to uſe the Word.</p>
                        <p>How dare then any thus counter-command God himſelf, and queſtion his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who is Wiſdom it ſelf, and hath expreſly commanded the people to uſe what theſe preſumptuous Worms and audacious Wretches prohibit them? Whom did Chriſt except, when he ſaid to all, <hi>Search the Scriptures?</hi> Joh. 5.39. Or whom did God, when he expreſly commanded that <hi>the Law ſhould be read to all, even men, women, children and ſtrangers?</hi> Deut 31.11, 12. This not knowing the Word of God, is the Mother of Ignorance, and that the Mother of all Impiety: If we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire therefore to know God hereafter as he is, let us endeavor to know him here, as he hath revealed himſelf to be; for the ignorance of God in this world, will debar us of the knowledge of him in the next, and for ever exclude us from that bleſſed experience the Saints and Angels have of him to all Eternity.</p>

                        <p>THe Diſeaſes of the Body are many, and many grievous, but the Maladies of the Minde are incomparably more and more grievous; thoſe of the Body make us ſick men, thoſe of the Minde make us miſerable men. The Minde can judge of the Bodies Diſeaſes, but how ſhall it declare the Diſeaſes of it felf, when it ſelf is diſeaſed; if the judgement be ſick, how ſhall the ſickneſs be judged? The inſtrument of judging is the Minde, the Diſeaſe whereof is not proper and peculiar onely to ſuch as are troubled, diſtreſſed and diſturbed in Conſcience, but Epidemical, yea moſt raigning in all unregenerate perſons, wanting a right reformed judgement to judge of themſelves, and therefore take or rather miſtake Vice for Vertue, Darkneſs for
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:97622:124"/>Light, and Error for Truth. Now of all ſores, the moſt dangerous is the wound of the Spirit, therefore is that the neceſſarieſt Doctrine which relieveth and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the Conſcience. And as the Word of God is mighty in operation, piercing the heart, and diſcerning the thoughts and intents thereof: So is it alone avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and effectual to pacifie the Minde, and to give full ſatisfaction to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. In this caſe of Diſtreſs of Minde, it is meet and convenient there ſhould alway be uſed a private confeſſion, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.16. not of our Faith ſo much as of our Faults: For the Phyſician muſt know the diſeaſe, before he can apply the remedy; and herein the grief of Minde and ſcruple that troubleth the Conſcience muſt be made known; for man hath but two witneſſes of his Thoughts, God and his own Conſcience, by which man knows that thing of himſelf which God alſo knows of him, and none elſe; for mans Conſcience is known to none beſide himſelf but God.</p>
                        <p>Now the moſt ſpecial and common diſtreſs of minde, ariſeth from a Divine Temptation, which is a Combat with God himſelf immediately; which is when the Conſcience ſpeaks ſome fearful things of God, and withal the party diſtreſſed feels ſome evident Tokens of Gods wrath. Yet indeed Gods Mercy is never ſweet unto the palate of the Soul, until it be ſeaſoned with ſome taſte of his Wrath and Indignation. This indeed is the true Tryal of our Faith, even when above and againſt Reaſon we relie on the Mercy of God in the Apprehenſion of his Anger. In which time of Temptation men are unfit Judges of themſelves and of their condition, how it ſtands between God and their Souls; even the faithful themſelves at ſuch time may cry out, and complain as if they were without both Faith and feeling of any favor of God, who yet even then is not abſent from them, neither hath forgotten them. The hour of Temptation with the Faithful, is the time of winter, wherein their Faith and Graces ſeem as it were benumm'd; but when the Rejoycing Beams of the Sun of Righteouſneſs break forth, diſſipate and chaſe away from the poor bemiſted Soul, the thick cloud of falſe and forged Suggeſtions, his Faith appears, the ſpring of Graces approacheth, they ſhew forth by lively effects, That they ſtill retained life and were not dead, to the preſent ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of unſpeakable comfort in the late clouded Soul. In ſuch Diſtreſſes let no man think the Weight of his ſins can over-ballance the Merit of his Savior. The Celeſtial Lights may ſuffer Eclipſes; and we muſt walk by Faith, not by Feeling. Now the true Application of Life Everlaſting promiſed in and by the Blood of Chriſt, is the general Remedy for all Diſtreſſes. But note, That the diſtreſſed in minde are not fit for comfort, till they be humbled for their ſins, for till then the Word of God is miſapplied, and ſo abuſed.</p>
                        <p>Deſpair is a ſin, whereby a man makes ſhipwrack of all Hope of the Mercy of God in Chriſt, ariſing from a falſe conſideration of his ſins which he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, or the good which he hath omitted, with a perſwaſion that God is neither able nor willing to forgive him. Thus the Deſperate man believeth not that God is either good, true, faithful or powerful; he may indeed have ſome conceit that he is ſo in general, but that he is ſo to him in particular, and for his good, this he will not be perſwaded of, but with <hi>Judas,</hi> conceits that God is not willing to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don him, or rather that he will not pardon him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. or with <hi>Cain,</hi> That he is not able to forgive him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.13. Thus Deſpair impeacheth the moſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Attributes of God; his Power, as if he were not able to make good his Promiſe; his Truth, as if he were unfaithful; his Mercy, as if it were dryed up with the heat of mens ſins; his Omnipreſence, as if he were not ever by us. Thus it ſtops the currant of Gods Mercy, barreth up the gates of Heaven againſt men, and openeth the mouth of Hell for them; which if thou wilt avoid, beware of Infidelity, for that is the Mother of Deſpair. And thus Deſpair ariſeth partly from too deep an apprehenſion of the power of the Devil, as if he were Infinite, and he able to do whatſoever his Malice would, or unlimited, God letting the reins looſe, and permitting him to do what himſelf pleaſed; and partly from too light
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:97622:125"/>an eſteem of that power which is to be had in God, as if he were not ſufficient to keep us ſafe, and of the Mercy of God, as if it were not Infinite.</p>
                        <p>Temptations to draw us to doubt of that help we have in God, and to Deſpair, are properly termed <hi>The fiery darts of the devil,</hi> which he ſhoots into our thoughts to poyſon the Soul with their venomous heads, thereby to draw us into Perdition. Theſe Temptations, where they light and faſten, pierce deep; ſhowers of them did the Devil ſhoot at poor <hi>Job: David</hi> complains much they were let fly at him; yea, he flung ſome even at Chriſt himſelf in the wilderneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.3. in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.37, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and on the Croſs, 27.46. He that Deſpairs, ſucks fiery burning poyſon into his Soul, hath the Brimſtone of Hell ſulphering in his very bowels, not a drop of the gracious Promiſes of God to quench it, becauſe he thinks the Puddle-pool of his ſins greater then the Ocean of Gods Mercy: This fire either ſtupifies the Spiritual Senſes, and dries up the life of the Soul, or torments him like <hi>Cain, Saul</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> intolerably, without all hope of redreſs. Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever therefore by reaſon of their weakneſs, or through the violence of ſome Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, have ſo let fall their ſhield of Faith, as that Satans fiery darts have touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Conſcience and pierced their Soul, let them not thereupon utterly deſpair, and give themſelves up to the power of Satan: but know, That a Renewing of Faith by a ſpeedy recourſe to the Promiſes of God in Chriſt, is a liquid Balſam to quench the flame, Virtual to draw out the fire, and Soveraign to cure the wound. Faith applying the Vertue of Chriſts Sacrifice to a perplexed and troubled Soul, diſpelleth the inward anguiſh thereof; but he that after ſome failings and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual wounds puts off all Hope, as if Death and Deſtruction without all Remedy, muſt needs follow thereupon, is like him that will rather dye then take Phyſick; murthers his Soul, becauſe it was ſick, haſtens his own Damnation, and by a Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemous prejudice to the unvaluable Merits of Chriſt, through Infidelity becomes the wilful Deſtroyer of that Soul which might have lived for ever, had he had the grace of Faith to apply the Remedy.</p>

                        </head>
                        <p>THe laſt Vice in oppoſition to this Commandment, which we promiſed to touch, was Pride; a ſin ſo obviouſly condemned, even by Heathen Writers, as we ſhall here onely abſtract it is as it were from that Pride which is ſo generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned; and, taking the word in ſomewhat a more ſtrict ſenſe, chiefly as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to Inward Spiritual Arrogancy, the inſenſible poiſon even of a ſanctified heart, we ſhall onely glance at it, and proceed to the Second Commandment. Pride is a puffing up of the heart and minde, proceeding from the opinion of ſome good thing in us more then in other men. Pride, truly ſo called, is the moſt peſtilent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible Oppoſite that Grace hath; and therefore he that is moſt ſanctified,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:97622:126"/>moſt fights againſt it: For beſides that impoiſoned tincture our Souls are ſtained with by this ſin in our depraved Nature, the ſubtile Serpent experimentally knows how to manage it with moſt accurate policy, who follows this poiſon with ſuch eagerneſs and activity, ſweetning it with ſuch ſpecious Deluſions, that after it is expelled by the Antidote of Faith, he yet endeavors with all the power and policy of Hell, that ſome ſpice thereof may remain behinde, even in the Soul humbled for ſin, and devoted unto the ſervice of God. For being exactly experienced in all advantages for Spiritual Aſſaults, and tempering the powerful Ingredients of his Temptations, with the Reliques of mans proud Nature, doth cunningly perſwade him to advance above that which is meet within himſelf, in his own opinion, the worth of his own Graces and Vertues; by reaſon of the predominancy and delightſomneſs whereof the undermining Venom and cankering Peſtilency of this ſin corrodes the Soul, and frets out the very heart of Grace undiſcernably.</p>
                        <p>This Lyon in a Lambs skin, ths Devil in an Angels ſhape, this ſin of Spiritual Pride is the harder to be expelled, becauſe ſo eaſie to be entertained, and ſo difficult to be diſcerned; ſuch is the inſenſibleneſs of thoſe <hi>Meanders</hi> wherein ſhe walks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly, when ſhe haunts the Saints and children of God; who with the more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection and holy policy are to fortifie themſelves againſt it, becauſe it ſprings from ſo fair and unſuſpected a Fountain, even from Zeal, godly Duties, and good Actions; who are with much Humiliation and fervency of Spirit to pray and ſtrive againſt it, becauſe it ſingles out the Choſen of God, and takes up his ſeat in the ſanctified Soul; who are with wonderful care to countermine the ſly inſinuations wherewith it unavoidably windes it ſelf into their hearts, leſt when they ſeem to diſclaim Pride, they prove proud that they are not proud; who cannot be too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure of their Sentinels on the heart-guards, becauſe there is no profoundneſs of Knowledge, no meaſure of Grace, no eminency of Zeal can be exempted from hazard of Surprizal, by this laſt and moſt cunning encounter of Satan by Spiritual Pride. Great reaſon therefore hath the childe of God. ſtrongly to fence his heart with a gracious and unfained humility againſt this ſin, leſt gazing on the dangerous ſpeculations of his own worthineſs, the eye of his Conſcience become blinde to his own Deficiencies, Corruptions and Infirmities; leſt his Self-conceitedneſs, and a vain over-valuing of his own Gifts and Vertues, call the Truth of them into queſtion, and extinguiſh the life of Sincerity; leſt an adulterous ſelf-liking of his own excellency, be juſtly plagued with a ſcandalous fall into ſome groſs ſin; leſt this Viper nouriſhed in the boſom of his Soul, take unſeaſonable heat and warmth from his Zeal, and endanger the whole frame of his New man.</p>
                        <p>Now the onely Soveraign means to preſerve the life and vigor of Graces in the Soul, and to keep thence this peſtilent canker-worm of Spiritual Pride, is with much earneſtneſs and prayer to labor after and ſettle ſurely in the heart a true and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſembled Humility. This kinde of Secret or Privy-Pride, is not ſo properly a breach of this Commandment, as the outward and more open Pride, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant Companions and Branches are, Envy, Anger, Impatience, Indignation, Self-will and Obſtinacy, Preſumption, Hypocriſie, Boaſting, Ingratitude, Contempt, Diſobedience, Ambition and Curioſity; as alſo a fained Modeſty or Humility, which is a double Pride, being to hunt after the praiſe and commendation of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility by refuſing in ſhew and apparence, and by denying of thoſe things out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, which yet a man ſecretly covets, and in his minde attributes unto himſelf, either truly or falſly: This is Pride under a vail; which, if Plenty and Proſperity in outward things anſwer the expectation, doth ſoon appear in its proper Peacock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colours, to be nothing elſe but the very heighth and pinacle of all Pride and Arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy, whoſe true Properties follow.</p>

                        <p>IN this Commandment God preſcribeth the Rule of true Divine Worſhip, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding not onely that Creatures or Images be not reputed or worſhipped for God, but alſo that himſelf be not worſhipped by or at Images: for if Adoration be given to the true God with a falſe and erroneous intention, it makes him an Idol; and to worſhip him in, at, or before an Image, is Idolatry and Superſtition, and God ſo worſhipped is made an Idol. And in thus forbidding the groſſeſt, and the Head and Fountain of all falſe Worſhips, he forbiddeth all the other kindes. Here alſo we are commanded to perform all outward Duties of Gods Service, according to his Will revealed in his Word, for the ſubſtance thereof.

<list>
                              <item>1. Becauſe it is impoſſible that God who is an Infinite Spiritual Eſſence, can be repreſented by an Image, <hi>Iſa</hi> 40.22, 25. yea, every Image of the Godhead is a Doctrine of Vanity; and though moſt curiouſly poliſhed, yet a very ſtock and teacher of lyes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.8.</item>
                              <item>2. Becauſe we have an expreſs Command to the contrary, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.15. neither can there any toleration be found hereof, repreſenting God by the Image of a Man; yea, the Lord hath not onely forbidden to make Images, but ſtraitly charged that they be pulled down and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in pieces, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.24. &amp; 34.13.</item>
                              <item>3. Becauſe the Lord is wonderfully provoked by Images, as appears <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.</item>
                              <item>4. Becauſe Images have often been occaſions of Idolatry, <hi>Judges</hi> 8.27. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.4.</item>
                              <item>5. Becauſe it is a thing ſcandalous to ſuch as be without, the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> are hereby hardned againſt the Chriſtian Religion, when they compare <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law with the practice of <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catholicks, and their temporizing adhering Apes.</item>

                              <item>1. Becauſe of the Commandment of God: for this aboliſhing of Idols is it that <hi>Jehu, Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Joſias</hi> are ſo praiſed in Scripture.</item>
                              <item>2. In reſpect of our Confeſſion, of our Profeſſion, of the ſincere Worſhip of God, and of our hatred againſt Idolatry, which conſiſts not in words onely, but alſo in actions, and in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhew and ſigns.</item>
                              <item>3. For avoiding of offence and Superſtition, leſt by retaining of ancient Images, the ſame danger come to the Church and ignorant people thereby, which in times paſt we ſee to have iſſued hence.</item>

                        </p>
                        <p>In aboliſhing of Images, two things are to be obſerved:
<list>
                              <item>1. That the Doctrine concerning the true Worſhip of God be preached before the aboliſhing of Idols. So did <hi>Joſias.</hi> Let the Word go before, and the Idols will fall to the ground.</item>
                              <item>2. The Images and their Altars, and the like Inſtruments, muſt be taken away not by private men, but by publike Authority: So hath God commanded the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> diſliking the <hi>Athenian</hi> and <hi>Epheſian</hi> Idols, did not notwithſtanding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf pull them down.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>Alſo, it is Idolatry to ſerve God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our own fantaſies: which is done theſe ſeveral ways; <hi>viz.</hi>
                           <list>
                              <item>1. By a kinde of Worſhip which we our ſelves have invented, or other men for us meerly out of their own brains.</item>
                              <item>2. By Reſting on the work done, bodily or outwardly.</item>
                              <item>3. By ſerving God without repenting us truly of our ſins.</item>
                              <item>4. By performing the Service of God and immediate duties of Religion out of Hypocriſie or for by-ends: For all theſe are Abuſes in Gods Service, and he is hereby made an Idol.</item>

                              <item>3. All things are to be done without ſhew of vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, not affecting notoriety, by Phariſaick ſighing, groaning, knocking the breaſt, and the like, more then the heart enforceth.</item>
                              <item>4. All things are to be done in Faith, to be accompanied with Zeal to God glory, and Love to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor.</item>

<list>
                                    <item>1. When a falſe God is worſhipped; that is, when in place of the true God, or beſides him, that worſhip is given to ſome either Imaginary or Exiſtent thing, which is due to the true God onely, and to be given to him alone.</item>
                                    <item>2. When men erre in the kinde of worſhip; that is, when Worſhip or Honor is imagined to be given and done unto the true God by ſome ſuch work as himſelf hath not commanded. This kinde is called Will-worſhip or Superſtition, which is an adding of Humane Inventions unto the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God.</item>

                        <head>§. 2. <hi>Of Idolatry.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>WHat Idolatry is, hath been already ſhewn: we ſhall now onely ſpeak a word of the original Antiquity of it, who are guilty of it, of the Ridiculouſneſs of it, of the Danger of it, and of the way how to avoid it. The Nations of the Gentiles had multitudes of gods, and every Nation his ſeveral Idol-god; as <hi>Chemoſh,</hi> was the Idol of the <hi>Moabites; Baal,</hi> of the <hi>Caldeans; Aſhteroth,</hi> of the <hi>Sido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians; Milchom</hi> and <hi>Moloch,</hi> of the <hi>Ammonites; Rimmon,</hi> of the <hi>Syrians; Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon,</hi> of the <hi>Philiſtims:</hi> but theſe truſting in their Idols, were all ſtill defeated and deſtroyed. Whence we learn, That the worſhipping of Images, howſoever it be coloured with falſe Reaſons, is the true cauſe of Gods Judgements; which Truth is not without a cloud of Witneſſes in the holy Scripture: So that the Laity under Antichriſts Juriſdiction, me thinks ſhould give the Modern and more refined Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters of <hi>Rome</hi> but little thanks for leading them to the Slaughter by the ears, and buzzing them therein, that Idols are Lay-mens Books.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> were very famous, or rather infamous, for Idols, great boaſters of them, not without cauſe indeed, for they were moſt exquiſite god-makers, not much, unlike the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Idolaters, who knead the Dough, and of one part they make Bread, and a god of the other; who cut down the Tree, warm themſelves with part thereof, roaſt their Meat with another, and with a third part make a pretty god, and worſhip it; who hew the Stone out of the Rock bedawb the one part with tempered dirt, and bow unto the other; who have their Plague-Saint. and their Childe-bed-Saint, their Tempeſt-Saint, and their Fair-weather-Saint. O Blaſphemous Idolatry! Theſe and the like are their <hi>Dii Tutelares,</hi> or their Patron-Saints, whereof they have one for every Seaſon, called their <hi>Protecting-Gods,</hi> as appears by an Hiſtorian of their own, <hi>Paulus Jovius, Hiſt. lib.</hi> 24 Now all the difference betwixt this Idolatry and that of the Heathens, even he that is as blinde as themſelves may diſcern; for onely the Names of the Idols are changed, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Idolatry ſtill remaineth, to their indelible infamy here, and fearful condemnation hereafter.</p>
                        <p>It is not lawful for a Subject to worſhip his Prince, or for a Son his Father, with any Religious Worſhip; much leſs may we worſhip Images with any kinde of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worſhip, or any Worſhip whatſoever, which at beſt are as it were but the Creatures creatures. Not to honor God, is intolerably wicked; to give his honor to any Mortal Man, is more ſinful; but to give it to baſe and ſenſleſs Idols, is moſt abominable. The baſeſt Image-maker that lives, is far better then the Image that lives not: What a groſs and ſenſleſs thing then is it, that the living Image of the living God ſhould perform worſhip or ſervice to the dead Image of a dead Saint; yea, to the Image of that man, whoſe Soul for ought they know is among the damned?</p>
                        <p>That we may the more abhor Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, obſerve how baſe the means are which have been uſed to eſtabliſh this curſed ſin of Image<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worſhipping, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.

                        <head>§. 3. <hi>Of Hypocriſie.</hi>
                        </head>
                        <p>THe other Vice repugnant to this Commandment, is Hypocriſie; and whoſoever will keep his Soul uninfected and unpoiſoned by this peſtilent and venomous ſin, muſt look to his heart to keep that ſincere, as the Root and Fountain of all his actions; otherwiſe it may deceive others, and it will deceive himſelf, but can never deceive God. Counterfeit Holineſs is a double Ungodlineſs. If it be a good thing to be good indeed, what Reaſon hath the Hypocrite to but appear to be what he would not be? And if it be an evil thing to be evil indeed, why will be be that indeed which he would not ſo much as ſeem to be? Wherefore let him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as he is, or be as he appears, for what will it profit him to ſeem to the world a very Saint, and to his God a Devil: A wicked man of himſelf as he is wicked, is too ſufficiently wicked; but when he counterfeits godlineſs, his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling of Piety makes every ſin he commits leave a double blot of guilt on the painted Sepulchre of his Soul. Without Integrity and Uprightneſs of heart, our Prayers, hearin; of Sermons, partaking of the Sacraments, or the performance of any other holy Exerciſes doth nothing avail. <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me,</hi> Iſa. 1.15.</p>
                        <p>Sincerity is as Salt that ſeaſoneth every work, the life and ſubſtance of all other Graces, without it the beſt things are no better then ſins againſt God; but to ſuch as are pure in heart he is good and gracious, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 79.1. &amp; 125.4, 5. Hence it is that men in this Age hate the Saints, under pretence that they are the Hypocrites; and this hath been the Devils policy againſt all holy men in all Ages. <hi>David</hi> was ſaid to be a ſubtile man to deceive others; <hi>Paul</hi> was reckoned the great Impoſtor of the world; nay, Chriſt himſelf was called a Deceiver. And indeed no man ſpeaks againſt Religion or hates Religion under its own notion, under its own name, but ſomewhat elſe, as Hypocriſie; indeed ſuch as have not Grace themſelves, cannot poſſibly judge of Grace in others.</p>
                        <p>Now in the ſtate of Formal Hypocriſie, may concur immunity from notorious ſins, all natural and moral Perfections, admirable variety of Learning, Policy, and all other acquired Ornaments of the Minde, an outward performance of all duties of Religion, ſome meaſure of inward illumination, a reſemblance or ſhadow of the whole body of true Regeneration, and a perſwaſion of being in the ſtate of Grace; even thus far a man may go in the profeſſion of Chriſtian Religion, and yet for want of true ſincerity be a ſtranger from the power of Faith, and from the life of godlineſs: yea, though a man were a moral Saint, an Angel among the Phariſees, abſolute in all other Perfections, yet without the inward power of Grace to give them the life of ſincerity, he is but a ſpectacle of commiſeration to Angels and Men.</p>
                        <p>The difference betwixt this Moral civil man and the Hypocrite, is onely this, That the Hypocrite doth much of the Firſt Table, little of the Second; but the Civil man doth much of the Second Table, little of the Firſt; neither doth what he doth in ſincerity; both do what they do in Hypocriſie: yea, though Moral Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty and outward Righteouſneſs be in themſelves good, and in a kinde neceſſary, yet by accident are many times a ſtrong bar to keep men from the power of godlineſs and unfeigned ſincerity; for reſting therein and not ſtepping forward, they content themſelves with a probable error of being in the ſtate of Crace, and with a plauſible paſſage unto eternal Death: for he which reacheth but to civil Honeſty, comes far ſhort of being in Chriſt, and conſequently of true happineſs. Thus the two main Engines whereby the Devil deludes the world, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnares the Souls of Unregenerate men, are Civil Honeſty, and Formal Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie.</p>

For as the abuſe of Gods Name is here prohibited, ſo the lawful and right uſe thereof is here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; which conſiſteth in the true confeſſion and magnifying of his Name both publikely and privately: The Reaſon hereof being taken from the fearful eſtate of ſuch as any way abuſe the Name of God, the Lord holding them as guilty of diſhonor done unto his moſt Sacred Majeſty.</p>
                     <p>The vertue then of this Commandment conſiſting in the right and honorable uſage and taking of the Name of God, muſt be the propagation and ſpreading abroad of Gods true Doctrine; The celebration, lauding and magnifying of his Name; The confeſſion of the Truth which we know concerning God; Zeal for God; Invocation; Thankſgiving; Right and lawful Swearing, which is compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under Invocation, as a ſpecial under the general: For an Oath is a religious and neceſſary Confirmation of things doubtful, by invocating God, or calling on him to be a Witneſs of Truth and a Revenger of Falſhood, or the calling of God to Witneſs for the Confirmation of the unknown Truth of ſome thing: Or, an Oath is an invocating of God, whereby is deſired, that God, who is the viewer of the Hearts, would be a Witneſs unto him that Sweareth, That he will not lye or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in that matter whereof he Sweareth, and that God would puniſh him that Sweareth, if he do lye or deceive. An Oath was ordained of God, that it might be a Bond of Truth between Men, and a Teſtimony or Record, That God is the Author or Defender of the Truth. He that taketh an unlawful Oath, as by the Creatures or the like, is bound to keep it, becauſe he Sweareth indirectly by God; or that taketh it by falſe gods, is likewiſe bound for the ſame reaſon. So likewiſe an Oath whereunto a man is drawn by fraud or ſubtilty, fear or compulſion, bindeth him notwithſtanding, if it be of things lawful and poſſible. But Oathes that are made of unlawful things, either by an Error or by Ignorance, or through Infirmity, or againſt the conſcience, may not be kept without ſin, it is ſin to keep them, as did <hi>Herod</hi> in Beheading <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> by pretence of keeping his Oath. For what things God forbiddeth, thoſe things he will not have men ſworn or unſworn to perform, and he that keeps ſuch an Oath heaps ſin upon ſin; therefore is it to be repented of with ſound and throughly unfeigned Repentance.</p>
                     <p>Here note, That Oathes extorted from men againſt their wills are to be kept, if they contain nothing in them that is unlawful, although they be unprofitable and hurtful to us; but unto wicked Oathes no man ought to be forced: neither ſhould wicked Oather be extorted from us by any torments, but we muſt chuſe to dye
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:97622:134"/>rather. But if any wicked or impious Oathes be made through fear or infirmity againſt our conſcience, thoſe do not binde us to performance, but muſt be recalled by ſound Repentance, becauſe what is impious to be done, that is impious to be ſworn: neither is one to be heaped on another. But extorted Oaches that are not impious, which are made of things lawful and poſſible, though hurtful and hard, yet are doubtleſs to be kept, becauſe thou art bound by Gods Law to chuſe the leſſer evil. And as by ſwearing falſly the Name of God is taken in vain, ſo alſo by vowing raſhly. Now a Vow is a Promiſe ſolemnly made to God of things lawful and poſſible, or a ſolemn Promiſe made unto God of ſome things that are ino ur power to perform, for the further ſtrengthning of our Faith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.21, &amp;c. <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5.3, &amp;c. This lawful and holy Vow is a profitable help to further us in the Worſhip of God; indeed a Vow is not part of Gods Worſhip, no more then Faſting is, yet they are both helps and furtherances of the true Worſhip of God; and it is far better never to Vow, then having vowed, not to perform that which is gone out of our lips: So as we may reaſon with ſuch Vow-breakers, as <hi>Peter</hi> did with <hi>Ananias,</hi> Acts 5.4. for they impudently mock the Majeſty of God, and thereby, to his great diſhonor, take his Name in vain.</p>
                     <p>In breach of an holy and religious Vow, there is a double treſpaſs; becauſe to the obſervation of a Vow, the man is tyed by a double bond, both abſolutely by Duty, and reſpectively by Covenant and Promiſe, and thereby violateth both his Duty and Fidelity unto God. For by a Vow we binde our ſelves for the doing of ſome ſpecial thing that is acceptable to God, or for the leaving undone ſome thing diſpleaſing to him, becauſe he alloweth not of our Will-worſhip, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.23. therefore we are not left free to Vow what we liſt, having then no Aſſurance that God will accept them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10.12. Vain then, wicked, and ridiculous are the Popiſh Vows of Pilgrimages, of Abſtinence from Fleſh, of Single life, yet perpetual Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity, of voluntary Poverty, of Friarly Obedience to ſuperſtitious men, and the like; not one whereof doth appear to be grounded in the Word of God.</p>
                     <p>The Popiſh Vows, many of them, are as blaſphemous as ſuperſtitious, for they Vow not to God onely, but to Saints, for which they have no preſident in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, no not when Vows ſtood in the greateſt force, and were in largeſt extent; yet they teach, That Vows are a ſubſtantial part of the Worſhip of God, and ſo by their own confeſſion commit manifeſt moſt abominable Idolatry, by communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating this honor to the Saints, thereby making them to be Gods. In the right maner of Vowing, obſerve therefore, That the making of a Vow was alway wont to God, craving his bleſſing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 61.5. <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.20. And as they muſt be made with Prayer, ſo they muſt be performed with Thankſgiving, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 6.5. otherwiſe it were better never to have vowed and promiſed unto God. And Vows thus lawfully made, are not meerly Ceremonial, or pertaining to the times of the Law, but are a conſtant and perpetual Ordinance of God, to be obſerved and practiſed under the Goſpel: yet becauſe the Jews were tyed to ſundry legal Obſervations, whereby upon occaſion they teſtified their thankfulneſs, it may not be unfitly held that Vows were partly Ceremonial, partly Moral; partly they were abrogated, and partly they continue and remain in full force to the end of the world, becauſe the Spiritual Duties ſhadowed thereby binde all perſons.</p>

                           <item>1. Open; when a man boldly confeſſeth the Truth or his Faith before the Adverſary even to the death: This is the higheſt degree of Confeſſion.</item>
                           <item>2. Implicite; when a man to keep his Religion is content to forſake his Countrey, Friends and Goods: This is a lower degree thereof, yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God.</item>

<list>
                                 <item>1. An univerſal and general Defection from true Religion. This Denyal is proper only to Reprobates and Hypocrites.</item>
                                 <item>2. Special and Particular, committed through error, not voluntary, neither purpoſed, through fear and humane frailty: This may happen to a childe of God, as in <hi>Peter.</hi> When a man is forced to deny his Religion, his offence in deed and in truth is voluntary (though ſome otherwiſe think it to be a mixed action) for compulſion doth not reach to the Will, but to the outward man, and ſerves to draw forth a conſent; and when conſent is yielded, he denies his Religion voluntarily; for <hi>voluntas non poteſt cogi.</hi>

Hereof are they guilty who out of novelty, curioſity, or for faſhions ſake, dare be preſent at Idolatrous Service: for it is not lawful for any man, being urged, to go to Idol-Service and hear Maſs, though he keep his heart unto God.

Unlawful Chriſtian ſlight in time of Perſecution: for though in ſome caſes it may be lawful, yet is Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection ſimply to be yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the puniſhment of Magiſtrates, for the better witneſſing of the Truth, though we do not alway tender obedience to their Commands. Now to a lawful Chriſtian flight in time of Perſecution, by a Miniſter of Gods Word, or any other man whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, are required theſe eight Conditions, that Gods Name may not be diſhonored, nor this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment broken; <hi>viz.</hi>
                              <list>
                                 <item>1. When there is no hope of doing good by his abode in that place where the Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, but otherwiſe he may fly.</item>

                                 <item>4. That the Paſtor withdraw himſelf onely for a time, not utterly forſake his Charge, unleſs his perſon be chiefly aymed at in the Perſecution.</item>

                     <p>That we may the better know how to avoid the diſhonoring of Gods name by our unlawful flight, take notice of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſigns thereof:
<list>
                           <item>1. When God puts into a mans heart the Spirit of Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Fortitude, whereby he is reſolved to abide and ſtand out againſt the force of all enemies.</item>
                           <item>2. When a man is apprehended and under the cuſtody of the Magiſtrate.</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>Gods Name is moſt commonly abuſed by Swearing, we will therefore now ſpeak of Oathes, and in the firſt place know that they are of two ſorts:
<list>
                           <item>1. Of things paſt, for the diſcovery of Truth.</item>
                           <item>2. Of things to come, for binding a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; which, if made unto God, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a Vow. This will be touch'd in the cloſe of this Commandment.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>In an Oath, which is of things paſt, three circumſtances are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, without which the Oath is ſinful and vain:
<list>
                           <item>1. That the thing whereupon we are about to Swear, be not onely true, but alſo that the Truth thereof be certainly known unto us.</item>
                           <item>2. That the thing be of ſome weight, as well to the glory of God, as to the love of our Neighbor.</item>
                           <item>3. That the Truth of that thing by any other means cannot be brought to light, for otherwiſe the very Name of God is contemptuouſly uſed.</item>

                     <p>In an Oath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting things to come, are theſe five things to be obſerved:
<list>
                           <item>1. That the thing be of ſome importance, for the reverence we have of God.</item>
                           <item>2. That it be juſt and lawful, that we call not God to witneſs what is contrary to himſelf.</item>
                           <item>3. That it be in our power, elſe we ſwear madly or hypocritically.</item>
                           <item>4. That it be of things certain, leſt we ſwear with an evil conſcience.</item>
                           <item>5. That in time we perform it indeed, though it ſhould be never ſo much to our loſs and hindrance.</item>

                     </p>
                     <p>There are four diſtinct things in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Oath:
<list>
                           <item>1. An Aſſeveration of the Truth.</item>
                           <item>2. A Confeſſion of the Omnipotent Preſence, Wiſdom, Juſtice, and Truth of God.</item>
                           <item>3. Invocation on God to give Teſtimony to the Conſcience of the Swearer, that he ſpeaks but Truth.</item>
                           <item>4. Imprecation, whereby man bindes himſelf to puniſhment if he ſwears falſly.</item>

<list>
                                       <item>1. A man confeſſes that which he ſwears is true in his Conſcience.</item>
                                       <item>2. That God is a witneſs not onely of his outward action and ſpeech, but alſo of his particular Conſcience.</item>

                           <item>2. From the nature of an Oath, which is a Teſtification of the Truth, and an invocation of God, whereby we deſire of him ſuch things as are agreeable unto his Nature and Will manifeſted in his Word, even that he will bear Record of the Truth.</item>

                        <list>
                           <item>1. When the Magiſtrate miniſtreth an Oath unto a man upon a juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion: for he hath power in this caſe, and therefore when he juſtly requires it of a man, then may he lawfully ſwear. Let no man therefore vainly imagine from the words of our Savior, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> Matth. 5.34. that it is not lawful to take an Oath, being thereto lawfully called by a Magiſtrate; for Swearing is commanded as a part of Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.20. And Chriſts meaning in that place was not to forbid all Swearing ſimply, but all Swearing after the Jewiſh maner and cuſtom; that is, in common talk and communication, as is plain in <hi>ver.</hi> 37. For this is a Rule to be obſerved in the Interpretation of Scripture, Things generally ſpoken muſt be particularly underſtood, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the circumſtances of the preſent matter in hand; as when <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He became all things to all men,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.22. if this ſhould be taken generally, we might ſay, That with Blaſphemers he became a Blaſphemer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as that ſpeech of <hi>Pauls</hi> muſt be reſtrained to things indifferent, ſo this here of our Saviors is reſtrained to the Jewiſh Cuſtom.</item>
                           <item>2. When a mans own Calling general or particular, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth an Oath: And this is in four caſes; <hi>viz.</hi>

                                 <item>1. When the taking of an Oath ſerveth to maintain, procure or win unto God any part of his glory, or to preſerve the ſame from diſgrace. In this regard <hi>Paul,</hi> moved with a godly zeal, uſeth an Oath in ſundry of his Epiſtles.</item>
                                 <item>2. When his Oath ſerveth to maintain or further his own or others Salvation, or preſervation in Soul or Body, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.106.</item>
                                 <item>3. When the Oath ſerves to confirm and ſtabliſh Peace and Society between party and party, Kingdom and Kingdom. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Abimelech, Jacob</hi> and <hi>Laban,</hi> Gen. 21. &amp; 31.</item>
                                 <item>4. When a man by Oath and not otherwiſe may free himſelf from temporal loſſes; in which regard a man may lawfully by Oath purge himſelf from infamy and ſlander.</item>

                     <head>The Fourth Commandment.</head>
                     <head type="sub">
                        <hi>Remember thou keep holy the Sabbath day: Six days thou ſhalt labor, and do all that thou haſt to do,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
                     <p>THe Sum of this Commandment ſetteth out a certain Day wherein God will have men to ſever themſelves from their ordinary labors, and to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly to his Service. As God reſted the Seventh day after the Creation: So Chriſt having ended the Work of the New Creation, reſted on this day from the Work of Redemption: And as Chriſt did ſubſtitute the laſt Supper in room of the Paſſover; So he ſubſtituted the Firſt day of the Week in room of the Jews Sabbath, to be a day ſet apart to his own Worſhip. From <hi>Adam</hi> to our Savior Chriſt, the Sabbath was the Seventh day of the Week; but from Chriſt and his Apoſtles it is the Firſt of the Week; that is, the Lords day, which was inſtituted for the Seventh day or Sabbath day, in reſpect of Chriſts Reſurrection. Now Chriſt in changing the Sabbath day from the Seventh day to the Eighth, did not change the Moral Law; for that change was no change of the Subſtance, but of the Circumſtance of Time: for the Subſtance of that Law, is the enjoyning of a Seventh days Reſt unto the Lord; now though a Seventh day from the Creation be not kept, yet a Seventh day is kept ſtill.</p>
                     <p>Hence then doth the Sectariſt vainly hold, That all days are now alike, and none more a Sabbath then another: For whereas they alledge, <hi>We are free from the Law, Rom.</hi> 7. it is meant of the Ceremonial Law, the heavy yoke whereof Chriſt took from our ſhoulders; and if in any place freedom from the Law be ſpoken of, it is either meant of the Ceremonial and Judicial, or of the Rigor of the Moral Law, enacting perfect Obedience in every point, or elſe threatning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Neither is that true which is alledged, Every day is a Sabbath
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:97622:140"/>to a Chriſtian: for it is Gods expreſs Command, <hi>Six days ſhalt thou labor,</hi> yet not excluding our daily Service to God. This continual Sabbath will not be till we come to Heaven, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.23. Neither may it be in the liberty of the Church to change the Sabbath day again: for as it was not at the firſt changed without Chriſts Authority, ſo it can receive no further change without him: And if the Church had this power, then might it be ſaid to be Lord of the Sabbath; yet without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning any opinion of ſuch neceſſity of this unalterableneſs in the Church, as to think it the leaſt part of any ceremonial Worſhip, it being now the Lords day, no Jewiſh Sabbath. And this is an unchangeable Rule, That one day in Seven, neither more nor leſs, is Moral and Perpetual. And although the Jews that believed, changed the day which was ceremonial, yet altered they not the Morality of one in Seven: For in the firſt change they kept two Sabbaths together; the Jewiſh, the Seventh day of the week paſt, in memorial of the Work of Creation which was paſt; the Chriſtian, the Firſt day, which was immediately next the other, and the Firſt of the week to come, in Remembrance of the Work of Redemption, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Sabbath at the Reſurrection of Chriſt for the time following; which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible ever to be changed again.</p>
                     <p>That which is ſhadowed forth in the Legal Sabbath, is begun in the Spiritual, and is perfected and conſummated in the Heavenly Sabbath. The Breach of this Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is the main ſin of the world: nay, Humane Inventions and Traditions are ordinarily better obſerved and more regarded then this Commandment of God: The people indeed would rather go to Church then to work, but to carnal Delights and Recreations rather then either; forgetting the <hi>Memento</hi> wherewith the Lord more ſpecially commands as well due preparation before, as unſophiſticate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance in the actual celebration of this holieſt of days. Such as make no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to take the Lords day from him, are Spiritual Thieves, and meddle with that which is not their own, never conſidering the wrong and injury that they offer unto the Almighty. <hi>God reſted on the Seventh day;</hi> that is, he ceaſed to create any New parts of the World, as being now perfect, and ſuch as he would have it to be: Good Reaſon therefore had the Lord of this day, on pain of Eternal death of Body and Soul in Hell, the place of the Damned, ſtrictly to charge and command that every Soul keep this whole day holy to his glory.</p>
                     <p>How dares then any creature-Man think his own thoughts, ſpeak his own words, or do his own works on this glorious day, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.13. the Lords own holy day. He that walks away this day in vain Diſcourſe, idle Paſtimes and ſinful Recreations, ſteps every ſtep he thus prophanely ſteps, one ſtep forward to Eternal Death: He that gathered but Sticks thereon, was ſtoned to death, becauſe he had not kept that Statute which God had enacted as by ſolemn Proclamation, That all ſorts that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs themſelves his Servants, ſhould wait upon him on the Sabbath. It was Chriſts own cuſtom, to preach the Goſpel in the Synagogues on this day; ſo alſo the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.17, &amp; 17.1, 2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.11. The Doors of the Temple were ſhut the ſix days, but opened from morning until the evening upon the Seventh day, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 46.1, 2. And this ſanctifying of the Lords day is a Moral Duty, and bindes perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, otherwiſe we ſhould have but Nine Commandments, whereas they are often called the Ten Words, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.28. <hi>Deut.</hi> 14.13. &amp; 10.4. And Chriſt came not to deſtroy, but to fulfil and keep the Law, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17.</p>
                     <p>Know then, we may not make this day a day of vain pleaſures and carnal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, a day of Sports and Recreations, thinking it ſufficient if we follow not the works of our Calling; neither may we on this day go or ride about our worldly matters, to buy, bargain, ſell, and talk with others, robbing God of his day to ſpare one of our own; neither is it ſufficient to obſerve onely ſo much of this day as is enjoyned by Laws and Injunctions of men, and prophane the reſt of it, thereby dividing the Lords day between God and our ſelves: And every ſin is ſo much the greater, by how much leſs the thing is for which men ſin; I ſay, the leſs the thing is for which a man will ſin and tranſgreſs the Law of God, the greater always is
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:97622:141"/>his ſin, becauſe the greater is his contempt of God: Thus was it with him that ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered Sticks on the Sabbath day, and was ſtoned to death for his pains: And thus it is with ſuch as recreate away the Sabbath by walking the Fields, who offend God more therein, then he that worketh thereon in his Calling for his Neceſſity. Yet here by the way we are to beware of a Jewiſh Superſtition, which Chriſt often refutes in the Goſpel; that is, to think it unlawful to perform on the Sabbath day whatſoever works belonging to the neceſſity either of his own life or of others: for by the end of the Commandment it appears, That ſuch works onely are forbidden as hinder the Exerciſe of the Miniſtery of Gods Word.</p>

                           <item>1. That by the Example of his own Reſt, as a moſt forcible and effectual Argument, he might exhort men to the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation thereof.</item>
                           <item>2. That this Reſt of the Seventh day might be a Monument of the Creation then finiſhed by God, and of his perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual preſervation and governing of his Work ever ſince that day, unto his own glory, and the Safety of his choſen.</item>
                        </list>

                     <p>In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth theſe two things moſt eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. That on the Sabbath day there be not onely a private ſerving of God as on other days, but alſo a publike ſerving of him in the Church.</item>
                           <item>2. That on that day all other labors ſhould give place both to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and publike Worſhip of God, which on other days every one doth exerciſe according to his Vocation and Calling. Now here we muſt know, That there is a threefold difference of forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding works and ſins; <hi>viz.</hi>
                              <list>
                                 <item>1. Labors are forbidden but in reſpect onely as they hinder the Miniſtery of the Church, or as they give offence to our Neighbor.</item>
                                 <item>2. Labors are forbidden onely to be uſed on the Sabbath day, ſins at all times.</item>
                                 <item>3. The ceaſing from labors is a Type of ceaſing from ſins, which is the thing ſignified by that Type.</item>

                     <p>The Inſtitution of the Sabbath in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice conſiſteth of two parts:
<list>
                           <item>1. A Bleſſing; God did bleſs it in regard of himſelf, becauſe he kept it in his own perſon.</item>
                           <item>2. Sanctification; he hallowed it alſo in regard of Man, by commanding it to be ſanctified or kept in performance of holy Duties.</item>

                     <p>Thus two things are requir'd in a Sabbath
<list>
                           <item>1. A Reſt, which conſiſteth in a ceaſing from labor.</item>
                           <item>2. A Sanctification of that Reſt to an holy uſe. This is the Sabbath of the New Teſtament.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God for two cauſes; <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects:
<list>
                                 <item>1. By that bodily Reſt the Lord meant to warn the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iſrael to abſtain and reſt from their own works being carnal and defiled, that they might ſuffer the Holy Ghoſt to work in them; ſo that it was a Type or ſhadow of our Regeneration.</item>
                                 <item>2. That circumſtance ſerved to ſignifie the Everlaſting Reſt of the Kingdom of Heaven, which was as it were part of the former.</item>
                              </list>
                           </item>
                           <item>2. The other end of bodily Reſt, is, That we may wait upon the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of the Church, meditate upon Gods Works, diligently apply our ſelves to the love of our Neighbors, and the inſtruction of our Families. The former end was taken away by the coming of Chriſt; This latter remaineth, and is perpetual.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are likewiſe two things to be conſidered in the Sabbath; <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. The things Ceremonial and Temporary: As the Jews might not begin a Journey on the Sabbath day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.29. nor kindle a fire thereon, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.3. nor carry a burthen, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.21.</item>
                           <item>2. The things Moral and Perpetual: As that there ſhould be a day of Reſt, that this day ſhould be ſanctified, and that this holy Reſt ſhould be obſerved in a Seventh day.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Sabbath ſignifieth a Quietneſs or Reſt, or ceaſing from labor, for theſe Reaſons; <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. Becauſe God reſted on that day.</item>
                           <item>2. Becauſe it is an Image of the Spiritual Reſt to come.</item>
                           <item>3. Becauſe we alſo, and our Families, and our Cattel, are to reſt and ceaſe from our works on that day, that God may then ſhew and exerciſe his works in us.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>Again, there is a threefold conſideration to be had of the Sabbath; <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <head>The Fifth Commandment.</head>
                     <head type="sub">Honor thy Father and thy Mother, that the days may be long in the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</head>
                     <p>THe Sum of this Commandment, is, That we perform all ſuch Duties as one man oweth unto another by ſome particular bond. Here are commanded all Vertues proper and peculiar to all kindes of Superiors, or to Inferiors, or common to them both; And all Vices contrary to theſe Vertues are here prohibited, as all irreverence towards thoſe that be in Place or Authority above us, and all churliſh behavior in ſuch towards thoſe that be of low degree. For the End of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, is the preſervation of civil order, decreed and appointed by God in the mutual Duties of Superiors and Inferiors, which are comprehended by the Name of Father and Mother. And the Reaſon of this Commandment is taken from the Promiſe of long life, if God pleaſe not to prevent us with the Bleſſing of Eternal life. Now to honor one, is to have an high eſteem of him, and to yield a reſpect unto him; it muſt firſt be placed in the heart, and then outwardly manifeſted, and that in relation to Parents Authority, and Neceſſity: So as honor compriſeth here all thoſe Daties which Children in any reſpect owe unto their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; it implieth in regard of their Authority both an inward reverent eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and alſo an outward ſubmiſſion; and in regard of their Neceſſity, Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and Maintenance.</p>
                     <p>Here both Father and Mother are expreſly mentioned, to take away all pretence from children of neglecting either of them: So that it is not ſufficient to honor the Father onely, becauſe he is the Mothers Head; nor the Mother onely, becauſe ſhe is the weaker veſſel: the Law condemneth him that neglecteth either. The Authority of Parents requireth Fear from children, their Affection, Love: Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in Parents without Authority, would make children too bold and inſolent; Authority without Affection, too much like Slaves: but both diſcreetly tempered together, make a very good compoſition. Love, like Sugar, ſweetneth Fear; and Fear, like Salt, ſeaſoneth Love. Thus the childes duty muſt be a Loving Fear, or a Fearing Love. This Fear is an awful Reſpect of his Parents, ariſing from an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable eſteem which he hath in his judgement and opinion of them as they are his Parents: Whence proceedeth on the one ſide a deſire and endeavor in all things (not contrary to Gods Word) to pleaſe them, and on the other ſide an unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to offend them.</p>
                     <p>This Fear is an eſſential Branch of that honor which the Law requireth to their Parents, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.12. and is in expreſs words enjoyned by the Law, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.3. This Fear keepeth Love in compaſs, reſtraining it from ſawcy follies; for as the heart is affected, the carriage will be ordered: Had <hi>Cham</hi> had this filial Fear in him, he had never derided his Father, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.22. nor been curſed for his labor; or had <hi>Abſolom</hi> had it in him, he had never broached untruths to father them on his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.3. Mocking and curſing of Parents is expreſly condemned, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.11. The Reward whereof is by Gods Law death, <hi>Lev.</hi> 20.9. yea, a ſhameful and ignominious death; for, <hi>the Ravens of the valley ſhall pluck out his eyes, and the yong Eagles ſhall eat it,</hi> Gen. 40.19. which phraſe not unproperly deſcribes the execution of a notorious Malefactor that is hang'd; and indeed how dyed unduti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Abſolom?</hi> Yet we muſt know, That no ſubmiſſion is to be given to man, but ſuch as may ſtand with the Fear of God: Which ſeaſonable Doctrine indicts all ſuch of folly as fear man more then God. This was <hi>Adams</hi> folly, to be ſwayed
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:97622:145"/>by a fooliſh woman. This was <hi>Aarons</hi> folly, to erect an Idol to pleaſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.1. This was <hi>Sauls</hi> folly, to ſuffer his people to take of the ſpoil of the <hi>Amalekites</hi> againſt Gods expreſs Prohibition, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.21. This was <hi>Joaſh</hi> his folly, to hearken to his Princes for the ſetting up of Idols, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.17. And thus <hi>Pilate</hi> played the fool, in delivering againſt his conſcience Chriſt to be crucified to pleaſe the people, <hi>Mark</hi> 15.15. As thus Superiors ſinned in baſely ſubmitting to Inferiors, ſo they likewiſe ſin in unwarrantably ſubmitting to Superiors. And if Inferiors muſt give honor, and by vertue thereof perform ſuch Duties as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thereto, then muſt the Superior carry himſelf worthy of honor, and by vertue thereof perform anſwerable Duties. If the childe honor his Natural Parents with filial Reverence, the Parents muſt anſwer it with Paternal care and tenderneſs; If the People make it their duty to reſpect their Miniſter as him that watcheth over their Souls, the Miniſter muſt make it his to tender their Salvation as of thoſe that are committed to his charge; If the Subjects make it their duty, beſide Subjection and Obedience, to pay the Superior Magiſtrates ſuch Tax and Tribute as is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully due to them, they muſt make it theirs to ſeek the honor of God in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and giving Judgement faithfully among his people; If the Servant make it his duty to do his Maſters work diligently, faithfully, and with a ſingle eye, the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter muſt make it his duty to deal juſtly with his Servant, and to reward him plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, remembring that <hi>he alſo hath a Maſter in Heaven;</hi> If the yonger ſort make it their duty to give ſuch reſpect to their elders, as is due to ſuch as are their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors in Age, Wiſdom and Authority, then muſt it be their duty to govern, and further others by the good example of their life, by their counſels and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; If the Wife make it her duty to reverence her Husband as her Head, he muſt make it his to honor, comfort and provide for her as the weaker veſſel.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, the duty of Equals, is to live equally among themſelves, and to ſtrive to give honor one unto another; For it is the duty of Chriſtians as to ſet forth the praiſe of God, ſo to be ſerviceable one unto another; and publike Callings may not hinder private Duties; nor may we upon pretence of one duty, though it may ſeem to be the weightier, ſhift off another, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.23. It is a general mutual duty appertaining to all Chriſtians, to ſubmit themſelves one unto another, becauſe every one is ſet in his place by God, not ſo much for himſelf, as for the good of others, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.24.</p>

So that it is moſt evident the <hi>Turk,</hi> and all Unbelievers and ungodly perſons, are but Uſurpers of thoſe things which otherwiſe Civilly they do lawfully poſſeſs: For all our Right to the Earth was loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> and is onely recovered by Chriſt; ſo that till we have our part in him, we cannot juſtly with a good Conſcience poſſeſs any part of the Earth: for he is Prince of the Kings of the Earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.5. and the High Lord of all the World.</item>

                     <head type="sub">Thou ſhalt do no Murther.</head>
                     <p>THe Sum of this Commandment forbiddeth all kinde of evil, and commandeth all kinde of good to our Neighbors perſon: So that the ſcope or end of this Commandment, is the preſervation of the life and ſafety of mens Bodies, and of the welfare both of our ſelves and others; herein being forbidden all thoſe things which tend to the deſtruction of our life or the life of others. And the defence of our Neighbor is here commanded; becauſe Negative Commandments include Affirmatives. <hi>Thou ſhalt do no Murther;</hi> therefore thou ſhalt help and aid thy Neighbor: <hi>Thou ſhalt do no Murther;</hi> that is, according to thine own pleaſure and luſt; but when the Magiſtrate puniſheth, God puniſheth. Now the Vertues of this Commandment are ſuch as either hurt not men, as particular Juſtice, Milde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Equability, Peaceableneſs, and the like; or ſuch Vertues as help and further the Safety of men, either by repelling evils, as Commutative Juſtice, true Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, holy Indignation and Zeal; or by doing benefits, as Humanity, Mercy, Amity, and the like: So that herein we are commanded to preſerve, as much as in us lieth, the life and health of our ſelves and others, eſpecially of our Neighbor, and moſt eſpecially the life of his Soul, by good Counſels, Exhortations and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions. Now here know therefore, That to give or accept the Challenge to fight the ſingle Combat, is unlawful: That which the Natural man accounteth Valor, God eſteemeth a Vice; and therefore it is no diſgrace to refuſe it, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther true grace in yielding obedience unto God, for no man muſt ſin againſt God for the ſaving of his Credit and Reputation among men. Duelliſts if they are ſlain, are acceſſary to their own wilful and untimely Murther; if they kill, preſently after the Murther committed, they have curſed <hi>Cains</hi> fearful Mark ſtamp'd on them.</p>
                     <pb n="274" facs="tcp:97622:150"/>
                     <p>There was never any man rightly informed either in the Principles of Nature, or in the gracious way to Heaven, in the ſober Paſſages of Morality, or in the Juſtice of State or Policy, or acquainted with the fairneſs of true Honor, that ever gave any allowance to the Reputation of Honor, falſly ſo called, purchaſed by private Quarrel in the Field. Now as Murther is one of thoſe ſins the Earth findes moſt unſupportable, and cryeth the loudeſt of any other to Heaven for Vengeance: So among all the ſeveral kindes thereof, Parricide is the abominableſt and moſt odious; ſuch as of old no particular Law was made againſt, as being ſuppoſed an act too unnatural for any Childe to commit: which Suppoſition deceived even <hi>Solon,</hi> that wiſe Law-maker among the Heathen, and cauſed him by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to omit the Enacting Puniſhment againſt ſuch Offenders, <hi>Cic. pro Roſ. Ame.</hi> Yet when this inhumane impiety was known to the world, the Civil Law ordained this moſt exquiſite ingenious puniſhment, That if any one ſhould kill his Parent, the Sword or Fire, or any other uſual puniſhment, ſhould not be his, but being ſewed in a Sack together with a Dog, a Cock, a Viper and an Ape, he ſhould be caſt into the next Sea or River, <hi>Juſt. Cod. cap.</hi> 9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 17. as unworthy to live the life or dye the death of men, unworthy the Element of Air while he lives, or of Earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead.</p>
                     <p>To this high degree of Murther, borders that ungodly and unnatural act of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents in deſtroying their own Children, whether at any time after Birth, or in the Womb after Conception: for that which hath received a Soul formed in it by God, if it be unjuſtly caſt away, ſhall be Revenged; yea, if both or either of the Parents through any wilful default whatſoever cauſe the childe to miſcarry, they make themſelves guilty of that miſcarriage; if both miſcarry, they make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves guilty of the blood of both, at leaſt in the Court of Conſcience before God.</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, becauſe this horrible ſin of Murther is moſt commonly occaſioned by Duelling, we muſt yet further know, That the Law both of God and Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth this common practice of Brawling. Fighting, Quarrelling, or Challenging one another into the Field for private and perſonal wrongs. Whoſoever think it a diſgrace to refuſe ſuch Challenges, think it alſo a diſgrace to walk in the ways of God, and to obey the good Edicts of Princes, and wholeſom Laws of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth. The greateſt diſgrace, is, Not to yield Obedience unto God, it is no credit to ſin againſt him to ſalve a ſuppoſed Honor and Reputation among men, for no man ought to revenge his own Cauſe or Quarrel. Likewiſe the cauſes of theſe Duels are moſt commonly very wicked, as ſometimes Pride and Vain-glory, ſometimes Drunkenneſs and Luſt, ſometimes Covetouſneſs and Greedineſs of Gain, and the cauſe of all theſe cauſes the Devil himſelf, who was a Murtherer from the beginning. The effects thereof are no better, for they cauſe deadly Fewds, breed Hatred never to be appeaſed, nouriſh Contention and Confuſion, hinder Prayer, and holy Exerciſes of Religion, ſhed mans blood made in the Image of God, and bring down the Vengeance of God upon our own heads. Let all ſuch therefore as challenge or accept of Challenges, conſider, That he that killeth is guilty of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable Murther before God, and he that is killed is guilty of his own death, and no better then one of the Devils Martyrs; for as God hath his Martyrs that dye in his Cauſe, ſo the Devil alſo hath his Martyrs, that dye in his.</p>

Good, when beholding the perfections of other men, we are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with our own imperfections, and ſeriouſly labor to be equal, at leaſt to imitate the good qualities which we ſee to flouriſh more in others then in our ſelves: This is called Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</item>

                     <head type="sub">
                        <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>IN this Commandment God forbiddeth all Vices repugnant to Chaſtity, and ſuch as are of near affinity unto them; likewiſe their cauſes, occaſions, effects, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedents, conſequents: And on the contrary he commandeth all things tending to the preſervation of Chaſtity. We are here commanded to behave our ſelves right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the principal outward comfort that belongs to our Neighbor, which is his Wife: Thus under one kinde of Uncleanneſs, all kindes of it are forbidden; for being commanded to live in temperance, chaſtity and ſoberneſs, we are to keep our Bodies holy and pure, as Temples of the Holy Ghoſt: So that the Sin here forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, is not onely the act of Adultery, but whatſoever is any way againſt chaſtity or ſoberneſs, either in deed, word or thought, directly or indirectly as a means of ſinning, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.28. where to commit Adultery, ſignifieth as much as to do any thing what way ſoever, whereby the chaſtity of our ſelves or our Neighbors may be ſtained. Chaſtity is the purity of Soul and Body, as much as belongeth to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; the Minde is chaſte when it is free, or at leaſt freed from fleſhly concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence; the Body is chaſte when it putteth not into execution the concupiſcences of the fleſh, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.3, 4, 5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.34. Marriage is the main help to keep our bodies chaſte: Now Marriage is a lawful and indiſſoluble conjunction of one man and one woman, juſtified by God, that we might know him to deteſt all impure luſt; That alſo we might therein chaſtely ſerve the Lord, and that eſpecially it might be a means whereby mankinde might be multiplied, and God gather thence afterwards unto himſelf a Church: Laſtly, that it might be a Society and fellowſhip of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, Cares and Prayers.</p>
                     <p>The Breach hereof is the foul ſin of Adultery, which beſide the fearful excluſion, without Repentance, from the Kingdom of Heaven, occaſions jealouſie, the frenzy of the Soul; which is a grief of minde ariſing from hence, That another is judged to enjoy that which we deſire to have wholly and properly as our own, and none beſides us to poſſeſs any part with us: Or, it is an affection proceeding from fear to have that communicated to another, which we challenge and covet to retain as peculiar and proper to our ſelves alone: Beſide this unhappy ſin of Adultery, that venomous ſin is the poyſon of Marriages, whereby the eſtimation of Parents, the reputation of Children, and the honor of whole Families ſtand in hazard to be forfeited; for as God is the Author of Marriage, ſo he is the Revenger of the breach thereof. But ſhame keeps ſome from thoſe unclean practices and groſſer acts of filthineſs, who yet inwardly boil in ſpeculative Wantonneſs and Adulteries of the heart. Ask thy Conſcience whether thou art one of them; if ſo, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, That no Adulterer ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, and repent: yea, the Fornicator, and every unclean perſon is alſo thence excluded, all Vices contrary to Chaſtity, or of any affinity with them, being here forbidden in forbidding Adultery; for by one Special, the reſt that are of near affinity with that are underſtood; and and where the Cauſe is forbidden, there alſo is the Effect, and ſo the contrary. Now the end and ſcope of this Commandment, is the Preſervation of Chaſtity and Wedlock.</p>

                     <head>The Eighth Commandment.</head>
                     <head type="sub">Thou ſhalt not Steal.</head>
                     <p>TO Steal, is properly to convey away any thing cloſely from another, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.20. <hi>Thou ſhalt not Steal</hi>] that is, Thou ſhalt not covet nor attempt by guile to convey thy Neighbors goods unto thee; therefore defend, preſerve, encreaſe them, and give thy Neighbor his own. Under this Name of Theft, are comprehended all other Vices of the like nature and quality, and all other which prove the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of this ſin; among which Idleneſs is not the leaſt, which is a lazy dejecture of the whole man from the laudable Exerciſes of Vertue: whence proceed Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction, Remiſſion, Negligence, Improvidence, Indevotion, Sluggiſhneſs, Puſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimity, Irreſolution, Deſperation, Miſpriſion, Omiſſion and Theft: Now the beſt Remedy againſt this Body-ſtarving and Soul-famiſhing ſin of Idleneſs and Sloth, is Devotion, being a ready Performance of all the Duties God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of us.</p>
                     <p>The Sum of this Commandment requireth the Tryal of our Love and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which we ought to bear our Neighbor in his goods: wherein we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to uſe our own Right, To help the Neceſſity of others, To be content with that which we have, To labor with our hands that which is honeſt, To do to all men as we would they ſhould do unto us, and by diligent pains-taking to get our own livings in that eſtate of life to which it ſhall pleaſe God to call us. And every Duty is to be ſeaſoned with the Fear of God; for it is not ſufficient to perform general Duties of Chriſtianity, unleſs alſo we be conſcionable in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Duties of our ſeveral Callings.</p>
                     <p>The private Vocations of a Family and Functions appertaining thereto, are ſuch as Chriſtians are called unto by God, and in the exerciſing whereof they may and muſt imploy ſome part of their time; for private Callings in a Family are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Callings, and therefore weak conſciences may not think, That if they have no publike Calling, they have no Calling at all. God uſeth to give his Bleſſing to men diligent in their Calling; So bleſſed he <hi>Jacobs</hi> faithful Service to his Uncle <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban, Gen.</hi> 31.4. <hi>Joſephs</hi> faithfulneſs to <hi>Potipher, Gen.</hi> 39.2. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were keeping their Fathers Sheep, when God appeared to the one, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.1, 2. and ſent for the other, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.11. to appoint the one a Prince over his People, and to anoint the other King over <hi>Iſrael:</hi> So <hi>Eliſha</hi> was plowing when anointed a Prophet, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.19. And while the Shepherds were watching their Sheep, there was the joyful news brought them of the birth of the Savior of the World. Thus pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Callings are bleſſed by the Lord; and our diligence therein is a ſpecial means to prevent this ſin here forbidden.</p>
                     <p>Now as there is a ſtealing of things, ſo there is a ſtealing of perſons, Mens Daughters, or Wives, or Children: Thus <hi>Sechem</hi> ſtole <hi>Jacobs</hi> daughter <hi>Dinah,</hi> and the Philiſtims <hi>Sampſons</hi> wife, and <hi>Jacobs</hi> Sons their Brother <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and ſold him into <hi>Egypt.</hi> This is more hainous then the ſtealing of goods, and is ennumerated amongſt other moſt horrible ſins, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.16.</p>
                     <p>Hence then it is moſt manifeſt, That the Anabaptiſts in ſtanding for a community of all things, take away the very ſubject of this Commandment, which is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of worldly goods: for if there be no <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> there can be no ſtealing, and ſo this Law ſhould be ſuperfluous. Touching the community objected in the Apoſtles times, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. it was not general, for in <hi>Antioch</hi> they had ſtill ſeveral Poſſeſſions; and the Apoſtles Exhortation to the Chriſtians at <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.1. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. intimateth, That they had their ſeverals likewiſe: And for thoſe that entred into this communion at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it was voluntary, as may be
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:97622:159"/>gathered <hi>Acts</hi> 5. neither had they all things ſo common, as that they reſerved not ſtill ſomething proper.</p>
                     <p>In this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are two parts; <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. The forbidding of Theft, and therein all evil Trades and Deceits, whereby we hunt after other mens goods.</item>
                           <item>2. That we labor to defend and help forward the profits and commodities of our Neighbor, and ſo help the neceſſity of others.</item>

                     <p>The three grand provocations to the commiſſion of this ſin; <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. Covetouſneſs, which is an inordinate deſire, a kinde of bad motion, whereby the Devil inticeth us unlawfully to withhold our own goods, and unjuſtly to covet other mens.</item>
                           <item>2. Prodigality, moving Bankrupts to uſe unlawful means for other mens goods.</item>
                           <item>3. Idleneſs, the Mother of Poverty, the occaſion of Theft, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.28.</item>
                        </list>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are two kindes of Theft; <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. Vulgar or common Theft, whereby a mans goods is ſecretly and fraudulently taken from him, without his knowledge, contrary to his will. This ſin of Theft may be committed by a Wife againſt her Husband, when ſhe privily without his knowledge conveys any thing from him, or conſents to diſpoſſeſs him of it, eſpecially to purloin it; neither can all that may be juſtly and truly ſaid for her Right in the common goods, defend her from the guilt thereof. Children likewiſe may be guilty thereof againſt their Parents, for <hi>Rachel</hi> having privily taken away though her Fathers Idols, the Scripture ſaith that ſhe ſtole them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.19. And all ſuch as counſel and encourage children to ſteal away their Parents goods, are acceſſary to Theft; no pretence whatſoever being any ſufficient warrant for children to defraud their Parents, it being better for them to be deprived of their Parents goods, then to enjoy them by the leaſt deceit; yea, they are worſe then other Thieves, being more dearly accounted of, and more freely truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and a very ill Example to Servants in a Family, and Subjects in a Commonwealth, beſide the cuſtom may in time bring them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Theft againſt other perſons alſo.</item>
                           <item>2. When any fraudulently circumventeth his Neighbor in any Contract or Buſineſs whatſoever, whereby he ſuffereth damage.</item>

                     <head>The Tenth Commandment.</head>
                     <head type="sub">
                        <hi>Thou ſhalt not Covet thy Neighbors Houſe, thou ſhalt not Covet thy Neighbors Wife, nor his Servant, nor his Maid, nor his Ox, nor his Aſs, nor any thing that thy Neighbor hath.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>TO Covet, is to think inwardly, and alſo to deſire any thing whereby our Neighbor may be hindred, albeit there enſue no aſſent of the Will to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that evil. And by Coveting here is to be underſtood, That not onely evil
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:97622:166"/>actually committed is ſin, but harboring in the heart, although it never cometh into act: So that this Commandment is as it were added for the explaining of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, becauſe the more ignorant people ſeeing no puniſhments inflicted for evil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, would not otherwiſe have thought them to be ſins. And it might be added to convince every man of Sin, for we all bear in us Luſt, the tinder of Vice. And this coveting what is anothers, doth always argue a minde either luſtful, or not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, which is againſt all true Piety. By the words, <hi>Houſe, Wife, Maid, Ox,</hi> &amp;c. the Commandment is illuſtrated, as by an Argument drawn from the diſtribution of the Objects of Concupiſcence: Whence it is apparent, That onely evil concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence is condemned in this place, <hi>Gol.</hi> 3.5. for there is a good concupiſcence or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire; as of Meat and Drink, and that of the Spirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. So then here are rehearſed the Objects of all Luſts for the moſt part, whereby we are ſtirred up to the tranſgreſſing of any Commandment of the latter Table. In the other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments not onely wicked deeds, but alſo counſels and deliberate conſent of the Will is forbidden; but in this is required ſomewhat more, namely, that we be not tickled with any kinde of Luſt, although our Will conſent not, yea alſo though it be againſt it: For here are forbidden all firſt motions of the Minde unto ſin, ſpringing from Original Sin, though no conſent be yielded unto them; and we are here commanded to keep our very hearts and mindes free from evil motions and thoughts againſt any of the Commandments of God, and to be well contented with our own. Thus the motions unto ſin forbidden in this Commandment ſpring from Original Sin, or the fleſh in us; other evil motions we are ſubject unto, that are ſuggeſted by the Devil, which are not our ſins, unleſs by conſenting we make them ſo. And the Duty here commanded, is our thorough Sanctification, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in deed, but even in heart and thought alſo, as in 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.23. the parts whereof are Mortification, the putting off the Old Man, which is corrupt through deceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able luſts, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. and Vivification, the putting on of the New Man, <hi>which after God is created in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs,</hi> Joh. 3.5. otherwiſe called Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration or a New-birth. The Sum of this Commandment forbiddeth all ſins before conſent and reſolution; all ſins without us, as <hi>Adams</hi> ſin; and all ſins with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, as the effect of the former. The Scope and end of this Commandment, is a Rightneſs and Inward Obedience of all our affections towards God and our Neighbor. This Commandment is added to be a Declaration of the former, and that Univerſal, becauſe this is ſpoken of the whole in general; and is added to be as a Rule or Level, according to which we muſt take and meaſure the inward Obedience of all the other Commandments. Hereby not onely corrupt inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſins, but the thinking of evil is ſin. Unto this Commandment is Original ſin or Concupiſcence repugnant, which is an inordinate appetite, and a corrupt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination and proneneſs in the Minde, Will and Heart, contrary to God, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring thoſe things that God forbiddeth in his Law, which enſued upon the Fall of our firſt Parents. Every Breach of this Commandment may be termed Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Now covetous men, the more they devour, the more they covet, like the Grave or the Barren Womb, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.14, 15. like Dropſie men, or <hi>Pharaohs</hi> lean Kine: Thus <hi>Ahab,</hi> that had a Kingdom at command, covets a petty Vineyard, which coſts poor <hi>Naboth</hi> his Life and Living; but withal, covetous <hi>Ahab</hi> purchaſed more then he coveted, the Wrath of God, the Deſtruction of his perſon, the ruine of his Houſe, the loſs of his Kingdom, and the undoing of all his Poſterity, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.16. The covetous man ſees nothing in another without grief to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; the more he hath, the more he thinks he hath not; the fuller his Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers are, the emptier he judgeth them; he as much wants what he hath, as what he hath not; the ſeaſonableneſs of Weather and fruitfulneſs of Seaſons trouble him, becauſe others partake of Gods Providence; he prays for a Dearth or Famine, that his commodities may ſell for more then he values his Soul at; he hates the Rich, becauſe he hath not ſomewhat they poſſeſs; he hates the Poor, becauſe they crave away his Life: As for Spiritual matters, he counts Salvation it ſelf not
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:97622:167"/>worth one years Extortion. This Sin of Covetouſneſs may be in the Poor as well as in the Rich, when they uſe ungodly ſhifts and unlawful means to ſtore them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Meat or Money, or any other thing, which is right Covetouſneſs; and when they murmure and grudge at their condition, not bearing the burthen of Poverty patiently, murmuring alſo at him that ſendeth it: for whoſoever diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth his preſent ſtate, becauſe it is not higher, richer and better, is covetous: This was the ſin cauſed the Rich man to forgo the Savior of Mankinde, rather then his Temporal Poſſeſſions; this makes it is as difficult a matter for the Rich to enter Heaven, as a Camel the Needles eye; this made <hi>Achan</hi> play the Thief; this brought him to ſo fearful an end, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 7.25. This brought the leproſie on <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hazi,</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> to his own Gallows, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.5. This is the occaſion of all cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in all Profeſſions, in all Ages, in all degrees of men, indeed the very Root of all evil.</p>

                  <p>THe greateſt Evidence of Gods Love that could be given, conſiſteth in the Forgiveneſs of Sin, which is well known to all that know the end of Chriſts coming (which was to ſave Sinners, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15.) and the extent of this Love of God reacheth to all Sins (except that againſt the Holy Ghoſt) which neither is unremiſſable in its own nature as it is ſin, but as the party ſo ſinning is uncapable of Repentance, and conſequently of Mercy; ſo that there is no ſin (that excepted) but cometh within the compaſs of Gods Mercy and Pardon upon Repentance: The Reaſon is, becauſe the Mercy of God is greater then all ſins whatſoever, and the Sacrifice of Chriſt is a ſufficient Price of Redemption for all; his blood cleanſeth from all ſin, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. From this extent of Gods Love it may be well inferred, That Mans deſtruction is of himſelf, either becauſe he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly deſpights the Spirit of Grace, or wilfully rejects the offer of Pardon. In the order of Redemption God hath made mans ſin pardonable, but man by his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency makes it not to be pardoned; for God excludeth none from the partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of his Mercy, his Pardon being offered to all; which yet muſt be underſtood of Gods outward Diſpenſation and Manifeſtation of his Mercy by the Miniſtery of the Word, wherein no difference is made betwixt perſons, nor exemption of any: So as it calleth not into queſtion the Secret Counſel and Eternal Decree of God.

                     <hi>ELection</hi> is a Decree, in which God, according to the good pleaſure of his Will, hath certainly Choſen ſome men to Life Eternal in Chriſt, and that for <hi>the praiſe of the glory of his grace,</hi> Eph. 1.4, 5. God Decree is that by which God hath neceſſarily, and yet freely from all Eternity, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 46.10. determined all things: Howbeit, the Decree of God is the firſt and Principal Cauſe of all things, yet it doth not take away the nature and property of ſecond Cauſes, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.29. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.2. but brings them into a certain order, that is, directeth them unto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate end, whereupon the effect of things are contingent or neceſſary, as the nature of the ſecond Cauſe is. When Chriſt was offered freely to every man, and one received him, and another rejected him, then the Myſtery of Election and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation was Revealed: The Reaſon why ſome received him, being, Becauſe God gave them a heart, which to the reſt he gave not; but in point of offering of Chriſt, we muſt be general, without having reſpect to Election. So that Predeſtination is the Decree of God, in as much as it concerns man, by which God hath ordained all men to a certain and everlaſting eſtate; that is, ſome to Salvation in his Son, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.9. others to condemnation, for his own glory and their ſins, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.22. Reprobation is Gods Decree, in the which, becauſe it ſo pleaſed him, he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to reſuſe ſome men by means of <hi>Adams</hi> Fall and their own Corruptions, for the manifeſtation of his Juſtice, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5.</p>
                  <p>Again, Election is the eternal, unchangeable, free, and moſt juſt Decree of God, whereby he hath decreed to convert ſome to Chriſt, to preſerve and keep them in Faith and Repentance, and by him to give them Eternal Life. So Predeſtination is an Eternal Decree or Purpoſe of God, in time cauſing effectual Grace in all thoſe whom he hath Choſen, and by this effectual Grace bringing them infallibly unto Glory. Predeſtination being thus an immanent and eternal Act of Divine Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Will, cannot be conceived as dependent upon any foreſeen Temporal Acts of mans Free-will; for Election findeth or conſidereth all meer men in one and the ſelf-ſame condition; and it is the Grace prepared for them in Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which maketh the predeſtinate become holy and happy men. They who will have God in his Divine Predeſtination to behold all men, and elect thoſe men conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, whom he conſidereth as believing and perſevering in Faith and Holineſs unto the laſt gaſp, are in an Error: for our Election is not grounded upon any foreſeen acts in us of Obeying, Believing, Perſevering, and the like, but theſe acts are grounded upon our Election; for whoever is predeſtinated to Salvation, is
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:97622:170"/>alſo predeſtinated to the Grace of Believing, Obeying, and the like, otherwiſe it were a conditional Predeſtination, but there is none ſuch, for whoever is elected to Salvation, is predeſtinated alſo to the means of Salvation. God in his moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Decree of Election, is as abſolutely and certainly ordaining men unto Saving Grace, as unto Everlaſting Life and Glory. And this Grace prepared for the Elect in Gods Eternal Predeſtination, and beſtowed upon them in the Temporal Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations, ſo cauſeth their Belief, Repentance, Perſeverance, as that it impoſeth no neceſſity or violent coaction upon the Wills of men, but cauſeth their free and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Endeavors.</p>
                  <p>All that are inwardly and effectually called, are Elected; but many are called onely outwardly, few ſuch are choſen. Now that God hath choſen ſome, and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by others, he is not at all cruel; for he owed not his Grace to any, but juſtly might have ſuffered all Mankinde to have periſhed. That ſome are Elect and ſome Reprobate, is known unto us in general, but not in ſpecial, whether this or that man be; but of our own Election every of us not onely may, but ought to be in ſpecial certain and aſſured, whereof he may be by the effect, which is Converſion, that is, true Faith, and true Repentance. Now if any one ſhall think that the Election of ſome before others, in regard of Gods ſpecial Mercy, came from this, That God foreſaw ſomething in them which was not in the others; let him hear what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith to the Jews, <hi>The Lord did not ſet his love upon you, nor chuſe you for your multitude, but becauſe the Lord loved you, and would keep the Oath which he ſwore to your fathers,</hi> Deut. 7.7, 8. And in <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.23. Chriſt ſaith of ſome, <hi>I never knew you;</hi> yet ſpeaking of others, he ſaith, <hi>I know my ſheep,</hi> Joh. 10.14. And again, <hi>I know whom I have choſen,</hi> Joh. 13.18. and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lord knoweth who are his:</hi> From which places we may ſafely gather, That the Lord puts a difference betwixt man and man, Angel and Angel, acknowledging ſome to be his own, and denying the ſame of others. If God himſelf had not avouched this in his Word, no man might have taught it; but being here plainly propounded, it is with all reverence to be acknowledged and received: whereof no other Reaſon can be given, but Gods good pleaſure alone, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25, 26. For, <hi>Jacob hath he loved, and Eſau hath he hated;</hi> neither did this difference come from their works, either good or evil, for this difference God put between them, before either of them had done good or evil; but it is wholly aſcribed to the Will of God, <hi>who will have mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth,</hi> Rom. 9. Neither muſt this ſeem ſtrange unto us, for we permit unto men to uſe their own diſcretion in their own Affairs, and can we think it unreaſonable in the Creator to uſe his touching his Creature?</p>
                  <p>Thus our whole Salvation is of Gods Free-grace, which in Chriſt is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from whence it floweth, yea it is the Beginning, Continuance and Ending of our Salvation: So that as for any foreſeen Faith and Good-works, they are not cauſes of our Election, but fruits and effects thereof: for what Faith or Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works could be foreſeen in the Sons of Wrath, born dead in Sins. God choſe us not becauſe he knew we would believe hereafter, but to the end we ſhould believe, that is, that he might beſtow upon us Faith, and ſo ſave us in his Son, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. and Faith is the gift of God to us, and the work of God in us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.29, 44. And if Faith foreſeen were the cauſe of Election, then Infidelity foreſeen were the cauſe of Reprobation, which is falſe, becauſe then all Mankinde ſhould be reprobated and rejected, foraſmuch as the whole Maſs of Mankinde ſinned, and God could foreſee nothing in it as of it ſelf but Incredulity and Unbelief.</p>
                  <p>Neither is our Election of Merit, which is a work undue, to which we are not bound, making the Reward and Recompence that was not due to be due; but all we can do is due unto God, for our Spiritual life is called a Debt unto him, both in reſpect of Creation, Redemption and Glorification; therefore neither is our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Merit, but of Gods own Free-grace.</p>
                  <pb n="315" facs="tcp:97622:170"/>
                  <p>Neither is our Election of any Free-will in us to good, for there is not any co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation (as the bold Papiſts affirm) of mans Free-will with Gods Free-grace in the firſt act of our Converſion, but God does all, and we nothing in good things, ſave as Inſtruments: for, <hi>God worketh both the will and the deed;</hi> he preventeth us with his Grace, prepareth us by his Word, enclineth us by his Spirit, and worketh both the beginning and ending of our Salvation: For Election, Vocation, Faith, Adoption, Juſtification, Sanctification, and Eternal Glorification, are never ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated in the Salvation of any man, but like inſeparable Companions go hand in hand.</p>
                  <p>Now the Elect regenerated and once come unto the Church of the Saints, may ſometimes fall from it, but they can never forſake it wholly, becauſe they never ſo fall, as to become the Enemies of God and the Church; nor finally, becauſe they perſiſt not in this Apoſtacy, but at length return to Repentance: Thus was it with <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi> Laſtly, the Notes of Election are Vocation, Juſtification, Sanctification; and all they who are elected unto Salvation, if they come unto the years of diſcretion, are called outwardly by Gods Word, and inwardly by his Spirit. Of this Election Chriſt Jeſus is the Foundation, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.9. The Decree thereof is that Book of Life, wherein are written the Names of the Elect, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.12. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. And the execution of this Decree is an Action, by which God, even as he purpoſed with himſelf, worketh all thoſe things effectually, which he decreed for the Salvation of the Elect: For they whom God elected to this end, that they ſhould inherit Eternal Life, were alſo elected to thoſe ſubordinate means, whereby, as by ſteps, they might attain this end, and without which it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to obtain it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29, 30.</p>

Gods maner of creating, as alſo of governing, is ſuch, as that by his Word alone, he without any Inſtruments, Means, Aſſiſtance or Motion, produced all ſorts of things: For to will any thing with God, is both to be able and to perform it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.5. The goodneſs of the creature is a kinde of excellency, by which it was void of all defect, whether Puniſhment or Fault.

The Angels each of them being created in the beginning, were ſetled in an upright eſtate. Man alſo, after he was created of God, was ſet in an excellent eſtate of Innocency: he was created perfect both in Body and Soul, and ſo had continued, had he ſtood ſtill in Righteouſneſs: His Soul is an Incorporeal Underſtanding, and an Immortal Subſtance, infuſed by God into an Inſtrumental Body, to inform and quicken it for the operation of certain motions and actions external and internal, by and without the miniſtery of the Body, conſtituting one perſon, namely, Man: for whoſe perfection it was ſufficient, if he knew all thoſe things concerning God and his Works, which God would have him to know; not that he ſhould know all things, for that had not perfected Man, but transformed him into God.

                     <hi>REdemption</hi> is a Deliverance from our Sins, by the Imputation of the Pains and Suffering of the due puniſhment thereof in the perſon of our Mediator: For Redemption is aſcribed unto the Son, becauſe he is that perſon which exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth the Fathers will concerning the Redeeming of Mankinde, and doth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately perform the Work of our Redemption; for the Son onely was ſent into the Fleſh, and hath paid the Ranſom or Price for our ſins, not the Father nor the Spirit. Now Chriſt is called the Redeemer of all Mankinde, not becauſe all are
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:97622:173"/>actually Redeemed by him, but becauſe no man is Redeemed by any other but Chriſt onely; the meaning is, he is the onely Redeemer of all men who attain this great benefit of Redeemption and Salvation: Or, he Redeemed all men; that is, in regard of the Sufficiency of that he did and ſuffered, for his Paſſion being ſuitable to his Perſon, his dying was more then equivalent to all the Worlds periſhing everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Hell: So that wicked men and unbelievers are not hereby ſecured, but more juſtly and deeply damned, as treading under foot the Son of God, and prophaning his Blood: For though Redemption be virtually Univerſal, yet the Faithful onely have their part in it, being ineffectual to them as have not the grace of God to receive it. Thus the Sun giveth light generally to all the World, yet are there many particular perſons that enjoy it not. But all that are eternally choſen out of the World into the Church, and continue uſing the means of Salvation, are Redeemed; it is otherwiſe in reſpect of all choſen temporally to a certain Office in the Church, as it was with <hi>Judas.</hi> Thus Chriſt in his Paſſion and Death offereth himſelf to all, but is given onely to the Elect; to all by the Preaching of the Goſpel, but he is the Savior onely of the Faithful, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. Now the cauſe that moved God to ſend this Redeemer, was not any foreſeen Faith or worthineſs of man, nor any merit or deſert by good Works, nor any inherent Righteouſneſs in us, but the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and Favor of God, his own Infinite and Incomprehenſible love and goodneſs.</p>

                     <hi>VOcation</hi> is that General Calling whereby a man is called out of the world to be a Childe of God, a Member of Chriſt, and Heir of the Kingdom of Heaven. This Calling belongs to every one within the compaſs of the Church, not any one excepted: for this General Calling is the Calling of Chriſtianity, which is common to all that live in the Church of God. An effectual Calling, or a Calling to Grace effectually, is, whereby a ſinner being ſevered from the world is entertained into Gods Family, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.17, 19. Now though all the Called are Members of Chriſt, yet we muſt know, That of the Members of Chriſt ſome are living, ſome dying: A living Member of Chriſt, is every one Elected, which being ingrafted by Faith and the Spirit into Chriſt, doth feel and ſhew forth the power of Chriſt in him: A dying or decaying Member, is every one truly ingrafted into Chriſt, who hath no feeling of the power and efficacy of the quickning Spirit in him; he is like to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numm'd Leg without Senſe, which indeed is a part of mans body, and yet receiveth no nouriſhment. They who are effectually called, are onely the Elect; for whom God Electeth, them he calleth in the time appointed for the ſame purpoſe. This Calling of the Elect being nothing elſe but a ſingling and a ſevering of them out of this vile world, and the cuſtoms thereof, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.13, 14. to be Citizens of the Kingdom of Glory after this life, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19. And this ſevering or chuſing of the Elect out of the world, is then performed, when God by his holy Spirit endueth them with true ſaving Faith, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.19. This effectual Calling to Chriſt and to his Goſpel, in which the Elect are onely called, is a benefit and effect of our Predeſtination; becauſe it is by the Purpoſe and Grace of God which is given us in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. it is not Univerſal to all, for Chriſt is Hidden Manna, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. therefore effectual Vocation is definite and particular; and thoſe
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:97622:174"/>onely whom God had before predeſtinate, them he called, <hi>Rom.</hi> 30. <hi>So many as were ordained to life everlaſting, believed,</hi> Acts 13.48. that is, were called unto the faith. <hi>It is not given to all to underſtand the myſteries of the kingdom,</hi> Mat. 13.11. <hi>Theſe things are hid from moſt of the wiſe of the world, and revealed unto Babes,</hi> Mat. 11.25. All therefore are not called effectually.</p>
                  <p>The Calling of God is threefold; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Gods general Calling, whereby he calleth all men to Repentance by the Goſpel, and ſo to life Eternal, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. &amp; 11.29.</item>
                        <item>2. His particular Calling, when he calleth and aſſigneth men to ſome particular eſtate and duty, in Family, Church, or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</item>
                        <item>3. God calleth ſome men to ſome private perſonal Duty, which he deſigneth not to others, but to be done by them alone. Such a Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling had he aſſigned him that would needs be perfect, <hi>Go, ſell all that thou haſt,</hi> &amp;c. And to <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he called him to leave his Countrey, his Kindred, his Lands and Poſſeſſions, <hi>&amp;c. Heb.</hi> 11.8.</item>

                              <item>2. Afflictions in Body, Goods, Name. Friends or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, tending to humble a man, and prepare his heart as ſoft ground.</item>

                              <item>4. The Preaching of the glad Tidings of the Goſpel, which is the moſt principal and effectual means of this ſpecial and effectual Vocation, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.14.</item>

                        <item>4. The Time of this Calling. The particular time of any mans Calling is not revealed, but laid up in the Secret Counſel of God, in whoſe hands Times and Seaſons are; ſome at the Sixth hour, ſome at the Ninth, and others at the Eleventh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Defer not therefore, but accept the Acceptable time.</item>
                        <item>5. Wherein this effectual Calling doth conſiſt, <hi>viz.</hi> both in the outward and inward Calling; eſpecially in the inward, when the heart is pierced, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.6. from ſtone, changed into a heart of fleſh, made tractable and plyable, <hi>Ezek</hi> 11.19. a heart like that of <hi>Lydia</hi>'s, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.15.</item>
                        <item>6. The Excellency of this Calling, being a great work, as was the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man at firſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. yea, this effectual Calling goes beyond the work of our Creation: for here a man is taken out of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> and ſet into the ſecond; in the Creation God onely called things that were not, as though they were; but here God calls not onely things that are not, but things that would not, and refuſe to be. To raiſe a man out of the Blood of Chriſt, is more then to raiſe <hi>Eve</hi> out of <hi>Adams</hi> ſide; to raiſe a dead Soul from the death of Sin, far more glorious and powerful then to raiſe a dead body from bodily death; to raiſe a man to ſupernatural life, far greater then to a Natural onely.</item>

                     <hi>J<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſtification</hi> is that benefit whereby God doth pardon and forgive us all our ſins for Chriſts ſake, and doth acquit us and abſolve us from the guilt of them, and doth accept us as Righteous before him in Chriſt: So that Juſtification is the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving of a ſinner, believing in Chriſt, from ſin and the guilt thereof, and the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt unto him, and the Acceptation to Life Eternal, freely for the Merits of Chriſt, with application of Chriſt on our part by Faith. The Papiſts ſay, That Faith and Works both are required to Juſtifie; we ſay, That nothing is required but Faith, and that Works follow Faith: They ſay, Faith and Works; we ſay, Faith onely, but it muſt be an effectual Faith, that is, a working Faith. This Propoſition <hi>(We are juſtified by Faith)</hi> being legally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood with the Papiſts, is not true, but Blaſphemous; but being taken Evangelically, that is, with relation to Chriſts Merit, it is true: For the correlative of Faith is the Merit of Chriſt, which Faith alſo as a joynt relative or correlative reſpecteth, and as an inſtrument apprehendeth, being the true Object of Faith. Good Works and Faith are disjoyned in the work of Juſtification before God, but they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned in the whole courſe of our lives and coverſation, both before God and Man. No work in man but Faith is required to his Juſtification, but it muſt be an effectual, that is, a Living working, not a dead Faith; and in our lives Faith and Works muſt go hand in hand together. In the Fire is both heat and light, yet in
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:97622:175"/>the warming of the body the heat hath force onely, and not the light, which though to many other uſes ſerves neceſſarily: Even ſo in a childe of God are required both Faith and Works, but to juſtifie him Faith onely is required, though Works be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary through his whole life; for they juſtifie us before men, and give us a Teſtimony of our Juſtification before God, not onely in our own hearts, but from the Lord, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.21. We may not therefore content our ſelves with a Faith in ſpeculation, void of Works, for ſuch is not true Faith.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>SAnctiſication</hi> is an inward change of a man juſtified, whereby the Image of God is reſtored in him; or that whereby a man being juſtified, is cleanſed more and more from the corruption of Nature, laboring to riſe up daily to newneſs of life, living in a continual pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tice of Holineſs. To be ſanctified, comprehendeth both a purging from the corruption of Nature, and an enduing us with inward Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. This corruption of ſin is purged out of us by the Merits and Power of Chriſts death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. which being by Faith applied, is as a Coraſive to abate, conſume and weaken the power of all ſin. And we are endued with inward Righteouſneſs through the vertue of Chriſts Reſurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.5, 6. which being applied by Faith, is as a Reſtorative to revive a man that is dead in ſin to newneſs of life.</p>
                  <p>This Sanctification is wrought in every part both of Body and Soul, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.23. it is begun in this life, in which the Faithful receive onely the Firſt-fruits of the Spirit, and it is not finiſhed before the end of this life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2, 3. And the Graces which do uſually ſhew themſelves in the heart of a man ſanctified, are the hatred of Sin and love of Righteouſneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.113. Juſtification goes with Sanctification, though Juſtification be before in Nature, yet they are wrought at the ſame time: for when God accepts a mans perſon, then is he made juſt, who is alſo ſanctified: And know, That Sanctification is ſuch a gift of God, as that in changing the man, it doth not change the ſubſtance of the Body, or the faculties of the Soul; but the corruption, diſorder and ſinfulneſs of man, it rectifieth, but abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſheth not affections. Sanctification floweth to us, not from our Parents, though regenerate, but onely from Chriſt, who is made of God unto us Sanctification, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19. in whom are hid all the treaſures of it, <hi>of whoſe fulneſs we receive Grace for Grace,</hi> Joh. 1.16. Chriſts Holineſs, as he is Man, being the Root of our Sanctification, as <hi>Adams</hi> Unrighteouſneſs was of our corruption.</p>
                  <p>Thus Sanctification is nothing elſe but the repairing of the Image of God in us, which was loſt in <hi>Adam;</hi> which Image of God was when the underſtanding was enlightned with the true knowledge of God and of his Worſhip, inſtead whereof by the Fall came the Ignorance of God and his Service, Wickedneſs, hating Vertue, and loving Sin, and weakneſs to every thing that is good. Now Sanctification
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:97622:176"/>amendeth the corruption planted in our mindes, and repaireth the decay of the Soul, otherwiſe caſt away and undone by Original Sin; for man by Nature is an enemy to God, full of wickedneſs, and a ſervant of Sin. This Natural corruption of the Minde, Will and Affections, which is amended by Sanctification, we call the Fleſh; the created Qualities of Holineſs wrought in the ſaid Faculties by the Holy Ghoſt, we call Spirit; and Grace is the effectual working of the Truth of the Goſpel, to the making of us indeed partakers of the Grace whereby we are juſtified before God. Now no man can ſee the Riches of Chriſt ſo as to be affected with them, without the help of the Spirit; for there is a maner of ſeeing proper onely to the Saints, and that is the work of the Spirit in them; otherwiſe we may reade the Scriptures a thouſand times over, we may underſtand them, yet we ſhall not be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with them, till the Holy Ghoſt ſhew them unto us. This is the ſecret of God, which he revealeth to thoſe whom he meaneth to ſave.</p>
                  <p>Now as the evidence of our Juſtification is a ſound and true Faith; ſo the evidence of our Sanctification is a good and clear conſcience; which Sanctification ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſeth Juſtification, it being a fruit and evidence thereof, in which reſpect we are ſaid to be juſtified by Works, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.24. that is, declared or manifeſted to be juſtified by Works, which are the fruits of Sanctification, and that the fruits of Juſtification. And we muſt likewiſe know, That the Gifts of Sanctification that are ſimply neceſſary to Salvation, without which no man of years of diſcretion can enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, as Faith and Repentance (conſidered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves) may both wholly and finally be loſt: for there is nothing in them or their Nature, in us or our Nature, to make them or us unchangeable. Angels fell when left unto themſelves; and nothing in its own Nature is unchangeable but God, by whoſe Grace of corroboration, unleſs thoſe Graces of abſolute neceſſity be confirmed in us, they may periſh fully and finally: So that the Reaſon why the Elect after their calling do not fall from Grace, is not in the nature of Faith, or the conſtancy of Grace it ſelf, but proceedeth wholly from the merciful Promiſe of God made unto the Faithful.</p>

                  <p>A <hi>Doption</hi> ariſeth from our Union with Chriſt, and is that whereby they which are juſtified are accounted of God as his own children; it is annexed to Juſtification, and thereby all ſuch as are predeſtinate to be Adopted, receive power to be actually accounted the Sons of God by Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5. from whoſe Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, whereby he ſtood in ſubjection to the Law, this Adoption ſprings. Hence it is that we are freed from under the Law, and have given unto us even the Adoption of Sons. And this alone is that whereby we ſtand before the Tribunal Seat of God, which alſo we are to oppoſe to the Judgement of God, to Hell, Death and Condemnation. In this Grace of Adoption there be two Actions of God; the one is Acceptation, whereby God accepts men for his children; the other is Regeneration, whereby men are born of God, when the Image of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored in them in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs. The outward means of Adoption is Baptiſm; not Baptiſm alone, but Baptiſm joyned with Faith: for the Scripture ſpeaking of Baptiſm, comprehends both the outward and the inward Baptiſm, which is the inward Baptiſm of the Spirit, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. &amp; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. Now this Adoption gives us Aſſurance of Salvation; for he that is the Adopted Son of God ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be ſaved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Moſes</hi> had an higher eſteem of this Grace of Adoption, when he choſe rather to be the Childe of God, then the Heir of an Earthly Prince, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.25. So did <hi>David,</hi> who though a King, yet regardleſs of his Royalty, ſetteth it at nought in regard of the Bleſſing of Adoption, who other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe could never have ſaid, That the Lord, not the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was his Portion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.

                     <hi>REgeneration</hi> is a renewing and repairing of the decayed eſtates of our Souls; or an Act of the Holy Ghoſt in Gods Elect, whereby they are entred into a conſtant and faithful exerciſe of a godly life. No general Preventing Grace in us which we have in our own power to uſe or refuſe, but the ſpecial Grace of the Spirit onely worketh in us Converſion, the want whereof cauſeth in us our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in ſin, for it is God alone who worketh in us both to will and to do; yet there is not one Effect aſcribed to the Holy Ghoſt, another to mans Will, but the ſame to both; unto the Holy Ghoſt, the Principal Cauſe, unto Mans Will as a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary and Inſtrumental Cauſe. Like that vertue proceeding from that Art in the Artificers minde, which guides the Inſtrument to frame this or that, the which without it could not be done; which inviſible paſſage or ſecret influence we ſee not otherwiſe then in the Effect: or like the vertue that directs the Arrow juſt to ſuch a Mark, ſo far and no farther. Such is the Secret Vertue, Divine Power, and inexpreſſible
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:97622:180"/>Efficacy of Chriſt, that works by his Spirit on the hearts of the Regenerate, being made New Creatures, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. The will and ability to do a work pleaſing and acceptable to God, is no mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e in the unregenerates power then their Creation.</p>
                  <p>Now by our Regeneration we are aſſured of our Juſtification, not as by the cauſe of the Effect, but as by the effect of the Cauſe; and though Regeneration be not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in this life, yet if it be indeed begun, it ſufficeth for the confirmation and proving of the Truth of our Faith. And though the Faithful fail in the meaſure of thoſe Graces they have, yet is it not ſuch as can juſtly impeach the Truth of Grace: It is true though it may be weak, and their Sanctification is ſound though imperfect; the Perfecting is not a work ſo powerful as the Beginning of it, for the very New-Birth and firſt act of Converſion is the moſt powerful work of Gods Spirit: for then a Sinner is anew created, of nothing (in regard of Spiritual Being) he is made ſomething; of a man dead in ſin, he is quickned and hath Spiritual life put into him. As a Childe born of a Woman hath all the parts of Soul and Body; ſo he that is born again of God hath all the parts of a New-man. All the Faithful have all ſuch Graces as are abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation, actually wrought in them; no Saint wanteth any Grace that may hinder his Salvation, though he ſhould inſtantly dye: the perfection of Sanctification is but the higheſt degree of that which was begun before; and without Regeneration there is no attaining to this perfection: <hi>Except a man be born again by Water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Joh. 3.5. Hereby a man of a limb of the Devil is made a member of Chriſt, and of a childe of Satan the childe of God.</p>
                  <p>Now the work of Regeneration in man, is a proper and immediate work of the Godhead; for to regenerate is to create, and man in that he is regenerated, is created again: Nothing then can actively regenerate but God, though Sacraments are ſaid to regenerate as Moral Inſtruments, becauſe when they are rightly uſed, God himſelf confers Grace by them. We receive not new and Spiritual life from the Son, but by the means of his Fleſh, apprehended by our Faith; yet the power and efficacy of quickning or reviving is not in the Fleſh, as in a proper ſubject, but in the Godhead. And we are not in this Regeneration perfectly ſanctified, but onely in part, not perfectly till death: whence it is that a regenerate man, reſtored by Grace, is not by his Regeneration enabled to fulfil the Law perfectly; yet of a meer natural man is made a new man, in regard of Gods Image reſtored and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. This is the reſtoring of that new quality of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Holineſs loſt in <hi>Adam;</hi> which is as it were a new Soul, for in a rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man there is a Body-Soul, and beſides the Spirit, which is the Grace of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification oppoſed to Fleſh and Corruption of Nature, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10. This is as it were the Soul of a Soul renewed, without which we cannot ſee the Kingdom of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. And laſtly, he that is indeed regenerate, hath this priviledge, That the Corruption of Nature is no part of him, neither doth it belong to his perſon, in reſpect of Divine Imputation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.17.</p>
                  <p>In the work of our Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration theſe three Graces be required; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The Preventing Grace; which is, when God of his Mercy ſets and imprints in the Minde a new light, in the Will a new quality or inclination, in the Heart new affections.</item>
                        <item>2. The Working Grace; which is, when God gives to the Will the act of well-willing, namely, the will to Believe, the will to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, the will to Obey God in his Word.</item>
                        <item>3. The Co-working Grace, when God giveth the Deed to the Will; that is, the exerciſe and practice of Faith and Repentance: The firſt of theſe gives the power of doing good; the ſecond, the Will; the third, the Deed: and all three together make up the work of Regeneration.</item>

                     <hi>COnverſion</hi> is a change or mutation of a corrupt Minde, Life and Will, into a good, ſtirred up by the Holy Ghoſt through the Preaching of the Goſpel in the Choſen; on which enſue Good Works, or a life directed according to all the Commandments of God. This Converſion of a ſinner, is not the change of the Subſtance of a man, or of the Faculties of the Soul, but a renewing and reſtoring
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:97622:182"/>of that Purity and Holineſs which was loſt by Mans Fall, with the aboliſhment of that Natural Corruption that is in all the powers of the Soul. This is the work of God, and of him alone, who doth it not firſt in one part then in another; but the work, both for the beginning, continuance and accompliſhment, is in the whole man, and in every part at once, ſpecially in the Minde, Conſcience, Will and Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: yet this Converſion is not wrought all at one inſtant, but in continuance of time, and that by certain meaſures and degrees, though in the very firſt act and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Converſion, the ſinner is both juſtified, adopted and incorporated into the Myſtical Body of Chriſt. Now we muſt know, That man willeth not his own Converſion of himſelf by Nature, either in whole or in part, but by Grace wholly and alone; becauſe of the want of that Original Righteouſneſs which was in man by Creation, as alſo now by reaſon of his proneneſs and inclination to that which is evil, and to nothing that is truly good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.21. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. for all Natural Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will of man in things Spiritual, is directly excluded, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. yet mans Will hath a work in doing that which is good, not by Nature, but by Grace: for when God gives man power to will good things, then he can will them; and when he giveth him a power to do good, then he can do good, and he doth it; for though there be not in mans Converſion a Natural co-operation of his Will with Gods Spirit, yet is there a Supernatural co-operation by Grace, enabling man when he is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, to will his Converſion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. Thus we ſee that man willeth his Converſion in the act thereof, but yet it is God that worketh that will in him, it is not of himſelf, as the blaſphemous Idolaters affirm: which here offering it ſelf to our conſideration, may not be thought any great digreſſion to ſpeak a word or two thereof.</p>
                  <p>This liberty of the Will, is a Power, Right or Ability proper unto a reaſonable Nature, to will any thing, to chuſe or refuſe any object, repreſented unto it by the Underſtanding, and to move it ſelf by her own proper motion, without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint or violent compulſion from any external cauſe. Free-will before the Fall was a fitneſs or aptitude in man to chuſe good or evil; after the Fall, in man unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate a proneneſs onely to chuſe evil; in the Regenerate a mixt aptitude partly to do good partly evil; in the Glorified to will good onely. Now the ſtate of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Queſtion about Free-will, is this, Whether as man averted himſelf from God and corrupted himſelf, ſo on the other ſide he be able of his own ſtrength to return to God and to receive Grace offered by God, and to amend himſelf: And further, Whether the Will of man be the firſt and principal Cauſe why ſome are converted, others perſiſt in their ſins, as well of the converted as not converted, others are more, others leſs good or evil, ſome after one maner, ſome after another doing good or evil. Now the erroneous Adverſaries to this Queſtion anſwer it thus, That ſo much Grace is both given of God, and left by Nature to all men, that they are able to return unto God and obey him; Neither that we ought to ſeek any other cauſe before or above mans Will, for which others receive or retain, others refuſe or caſt away Divine Succor and Aid in a voiding Sin, and do after this or that maner order and inſtitute their Counſels and Actions.</p>
                  <p>Contrary to this Opinion do we learn out of the Sacred Scripture, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though by Nature ſo much of God and his Will be known to all, as may ſuffice for taking away all excuſe from them of ſin; and although it be manifeſt, That many Works morally good may be done even of the Unregenerate, and the Will doth freely in them make choyce either of good or evil, yet no work pleaſing to God can be undertaken or performed by any man, without Regeneration, and the eſpecial Grace of the Holy Spirit; Neither can more or leſs good be in any mans Counſels or Actions, then God of his free and purpoſed goodneſs doth cauſe in them; Neither any other way can the Will of any Creature be inclined, then whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſhall ſeem good to the Eternal and good Counſel of God: and yet all the actions of the created Will are wrought freely, whether they be good or bad. Now Free-will to outward good actions, without an inward Faith and Obedience,
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:97622:182"/>is not Free-will to good, for outward actions good in themſelves, are made evil by want of inward Faith and Obedience, which is onely in the Regenerate; whoſe Wills are not taken away, but corrected, as which before would onely that which is evil, will now that which is good, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. which being inclined, moved and governed by Gods Spirit, will themſelves of their own accord, and are able to work do well and work well; that is, becauſe God worketh good things not onely in them, but alſo by them, as joynt-workers with him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. and in them both the will and the deed even of his good pleaſure, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13.</p>
                  <p>To do any thing with free arbitrement and will, is to do any thing upon a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliberation according to the Will of God, ſometimes ſimply, and ſometimes in ſome reſpect onely; yea, and againſt it alſo ſometimes in ſome reſpect, but never ſimply againſt it: for the liberty of working is not taken away in any creature, when God is ſaid ſo to rule and bend their Wills, that they be not inclined any other way then whither God will have them inclined, either ſimply or in ſome ſort. And there is no ſuch will of free working, as excludeth all action and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the firſt Cauſe, guiding, inviting and bending the Creatures Wills whither it ſelf liſteth. The Wills of Angels and Men are ſo the cauſers of their actions, that nevertheleſs they are carried by the Secret Counſel of God, and his Power and Efficacy, which is every where preſent, to the chuſing or refuſing of any object; and that immediately by God, or mediately by Inſtruments, ſome good, ſome bad, as it ſeemeth good unto God to uſe; ſo that it is impoſſible for them to do any thing beſide the Eternal Decree and Counſel of God: therefore God is ſaid to be abſolutely, perfectly, and ſimply his own, and at his own Will, but man onely vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary and free in ſome reſpects.</p>
                  <p>The Will is able notwithſtanding not onely to withſtand God moving it, but alſo of its own proper motion to aſſent and obey him, it ſelf exerciſing and moving her own actions; and yet this is to be underſtood of the actions of the Will, not of the new Qualities or Inclinations which it hath to obey God: for theſe the Will receiveth not by her own operation, but by the working of the Holy Ghoſt: And the Will of man withſtanding the Revealed Will of God, is yet guided by his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Will, and therefore reſiſting doth not reſiſt; for the Secret Decrees of Gods Will and Providence are ever ratified and performed in thoſe, even in thoſe who moſt of all withſtand Gods Commandments. Neither yet are there contrary Wills in God, for nothing is found in his Secret Purpoſes, which diſagreeth with his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture revealed in his Word; and God openeth unto us in his Law what he approveth and liketh, and what agreeth with his Nature, and the order of his Minde: but he doth not promiſe or reveal how much Grace he will or purpoſeth to give to every one to obey his Commandments. And though God be chiefly the Mover of wicked Wills, yet is he not the Mover of the Wickedneſs of the Wills; for they diſagree from the Law, not as they are any way ordained by the Will of God, but as they are done by Men or Devils, by reaſon of this defect, that either they do not know the Will of God when they do them, or are not moved by the ſight or knowledge thereof to do it; that is, they do it not to that end that they may obey God who will ſo have it. For this Reaſon God cannot be the Author of the wickedneſs of the Will: Beſides, though now ſince the Corruption of our Nature by the Fall we have not Free-will to convert our ſelves, nor to turn unto God of our ſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the operation of his holy Spirit, yet our inclinations bent by his Spirit, the Will works freely, though God works by it as an Inſtrument, otherwiſe the Will were idle, which cannot be.</p>
                  <p>And albeit God was able to have wrought what he would without the Will, yet becauſe he will work by the Will, the working of the Will is not in vain; nor can God hence be ſaid to will the actions of ſinners, as they are ſins; but he wills them as they are Puniſhments of ſins, and the execution of his juſt Judgement. And we muſt know, That what liberty of Will we have to do good or to will it, is onely but in part, <hi>viz.</hi> as we are regenerated by his holy Spirit; but not in whole and full,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:97622:183"/>neither in that degree in which before the Fall we had it, and ſhall have in the life to come. And although the Unregenerate are able to will onely thoſe things which are evil; yet they will them without conſtraint, even by their own proper and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward motion, and therefore freely: but the will and ability to do good Works is no more in their power, then the Creation: for the liberty which is in man now after the Fall, and not yet regenerated and recovered, is the very bondage of ſin: yet God had made man ſuch a one as was able to perform that Obedience which he requireth of him. Wherefore man by his own fault and folly loſing, and of his own accord caſting away this ability, God nevertheleſs hath not therefore loſt his Right to require Obedience from him.</p>

                        <item>2. The VVord; which is the Inſtrument of the Holy Ghoſt: for now he worketh not by Revelation or ſpecial inſtinct, but ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily in and by the VVord.</item>
                        <item>3. Mans VVill; which though by Nature be evil, and dead unto Grace, yet being renewed by the Holy Ghoſt, in the very firſt act of Converſion moveth and ſtriveth to be turned. It is not like wax, onely paſſive, but as fire, ſo ſoon as it is fire, doth burn; and ſo ſoon as it burneth, it is fire: So the VVill, though by Nature it move not, yet being renewed by Grace, it moveth; and ſo ſoon as it moveth, it is renewed.</item>

                        <item>3. In the Effect; for in the wicked New-Obedience doth not follow Repentance, which always accompanieth the Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the godly: ſo that the Repentance of the wicked is no true, no ſound, no ſaving Repentance.</item>

                     <hi>SIN</hi> in its proper nature is an Anomy, that is, a want of Conformity to the Law of God. The nature of ſin lies not in the action, but in the maner of doing the action; and ſin properly is nothing formally ſubſiſting or exiſting, for then God ſhould be the Author of it, but it is an Ataxy or Abſence of goodneſs in the thing that ſubſiſteth; whereupon it is truly ſaid in Schools, <hi>In peccato nihil poſitivum,</hi> whatſoever a man doth whereof he is not certainly perſwaded in judgement and conſcience out of Gods Word, that it may be done, is ſin. Original Sin is the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the whole man, and chiefly of the Soul of man, and is not onely an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of goodneſs, but alſo a real preſence of an evil property and diſpoſition; and this infection of Nature doth remain, yea in them that are Regenerated. For the Principle of Fleſh that is in holy men may ſometimes prevail mightily upon them, yea ſo as to make them do as evil actions as the worſt of men; for this is a true Rule, A man that excelleth in Grace, may ſometimes excel in ill-doing; but he allows not himſelf therein, nor is it properly he that does it, but ſin that dwelleth
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:97622:185"/>in him; as the good that evil men do, it cannot be ſaid that they do it, Gods Spirit may be there to help them to do much, but the Spirit dwelleth not there, ſo a man may do good and not be good.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, things though commanded, yet in the unregenerate become ſins; it is ſin when a wicked man giveth Alms, becauſe it proceeds not from Faith and Love; yet the Moral actions of the unregenerate are not to be omitted by us, becauſe in them they are ſin, but we muſt avoid the ſin, and perform the action; avoid not the works of Hypocrites, but the hypocriſie of their works. Thus is ſin the Corruption of a Nature created good of God, but not any Creature, made of God in man; for it is onely an accidental Quality or natural Property of man cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, but no ſubſtantial Property, nor of the nature of man ſimply as he was firſt created. <hi>Solomon</hi> hath drawn the picture of Sin to the life in the Deſcription of an Harlot; the Fawns, Flatters, Pleaſes, Delights, but in the end Deſtroys; it ſpeaks to us in <hi>Joabs</hi> language to <hi>Amaſa,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.10. and his kiſſes are as mortal; or in <hi>Jaels</hi> language to <hi>Siſera, Judg.</hi> 4.18. &amp; 5.26, 27. but <hi>the Butter in the lordly Diſh</hi> will not balſum the wound it gives. All ſin is like the painted Harlot, or the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful forbidden Fruit; he that ſucks the Honey-comb of ſin, ſucks the Poiſon of Aſps; it is a golden Hook baited with all the Glory of the World. All ſin is foul, filthy, unclean, infectious, contagious, and loathſom in the ſight of God, <hi>Levit.</hi> 18.24. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.18. <hi>Matth</hi> 15.19, 20. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27. It is compared to an unclean cloth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.6. to the Blood of pollution, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.6. <hi>Levit.</hi> 15.19. It polluteth and prophaneth the actions of greateſt Devotion in the Service of God, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.13. It defileth the Land and places where ſinners are converſant, <hi>Lev.</hi> 18.24, 25. And as the Dropſie man, the more he drinks the dryer he is, and the more he ſtill deſires to drink: So a ſinner, the more he ſins the apter he is to ſin, and the more deſirous to keep ſtill in a courſe of wickedneſs. Cuſtom in ſinning breeds hardneſs of heart, Hardneſs of heart brings Impenitency, and Impenitency, Condemnation; that men of years living in the Church are not ſimply condemned for their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſins, but their continuance and reſidence in them; and though every ſin be mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, yet are not all equally mortal, but ſome more, ſome leſs; nor do ſins com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted utterly take away Grace, but rather ſometimes do make it the more to ſhine and ſhew it ſelf. Thus can God turn every thing to the beſt to thoſe that are his, yea ſo as we may ſay we gained by <hi>Adams</hi> Fall: whence deſcended unto us that Original Sin, which the Papiſts ſay is not Sin properly ſo called, but onely becauſe this Original Corruption in all men at their conception is an occaſion or cauſe of Sin, but as for the Sin it ſelf which was in this corruption of Nature, they ſay it was taken away by Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.18. And herein the Anabaptiſts agree with the Papiſts, for they alſo hold that Original Sin was taken away by Chriſt; yet <hi>David,</hi> as righteous man as any Anabaptiſt or Papiſt, confeſſed that <hi>he was conceived in ſin, and born in iniquity,</hi> Pſal. 51.5. For Chriſt taketh not Sin away but as he ſaveth, <hi>viz.</hi> from all ſuch as truly believe in him, to whom it is no more imputed: Nor is God (as ſome blaſphemouſly imagine) the Author of <hi>Adams</hi> Fall; for the unchangeable Decree and Will of God, takes not away the liberty of mans Will or of Second Cauſes, but onely enclineth and ordereth the ſame, as the firſt and higheſt Cauſe: So that Gods Decree went before <hi>Adams</hi> Fall onely as an Antecedent, not as a Cauſe thereof; and though <hi>Adam</hi> fell not without Gods general permiſſive Will, yet without his ſpecial approving Will; and he having full power and liberty to ſtand, God can no way be ſaid to be the Author of his Fall, nor conſequently of Sin. And now when man is puniſhed for Sin, other Creatures ſuffer with him, though had not man faln it had been otherwiſe; but now as Inſtruments of evil man oftentimes doth horribly abuſe them, to the diſhonor of the Creator; therefore do the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures groan, as weary of wicked men: and yet to this ungrateful Creature (Man) doth the Goodneſs and Mercy of God appear infinite like himſelf, in that the Air doth ſtill yield man breath and not poyſon him; in that the Water ſo variouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodates him, and not drowns him; that the Fire comforts, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:97622:185"/>him; that the Earth bears and ſuſtains him, and not through drought prove barren, parch up, and cleave aſunder to ſwallow him; that his Food doth nouriſh and not choak him; that Death doth ſpare and not ſtrike; yea, that Hell is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered for him. O the depth, the depth, the depth of the Goodneſs of God to this faln, reſtored, yet ungrateful Creature Man! yea, there had not been any ſuch thing at all as Death, had not man diſobeyed, for God made not Death in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, nor ſhould it have been, except of our ſelves: for it enſued on the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Sin of man, God forcibly inflicting it, as a moſt juſt Puniſhment, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Puniſhments of this life, are but the beginning of Everlaſting, becauſe they are not ſufficient here to ſatisfie Gods Juſtice; and though God doth not ſo puniſh the ſins of the godly, yet is not his Juſtice impeached thereby, becauſe he puniſhed them in Chriſt with a puniſhment Temporal, yet equivalent to Everlaſting; which equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility doth the Goſpel adde unto the rigor and ſeverity of the Law. Now the Judgements of God are not onely Puniſhments to the Sufferers and Offenders, but alſo Documents and Inſtructions to all others that behold them, know them, and hear them; they are as Sermons to Repentance, for this very end and purpoſe he worketh them, and therefore they muſt be Inſtructions to us, to avoid the occaſion of them, which is Sin.</p>
                  <p>The Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, is, when any after that he hath by the Holy Ghoſt been lightned with the knowledge of the Truth of the Goſpel, doth ſtand againſt that Truth, not for fear, or through infirmity, but on wilful Malice; for this Sin is a ſpightful reſiſtance of the Goſpel againſt the knowledge and light of Conſcience, after the Spirit hath perſwaded the heart of the Truth and Benefit thereof; and when a man ſinneth out of malice and ſpight againſt God himſelf and Chriſt Jeſus: which is not every ſin of Preſumption, or againſt Knowledge and Conſcience; but ſuch a kinde of preſumptuous Offence, in which true Religion is renounced; and that of ſet purpoſe and reſolved malice againſt the very Majeſty of God himſelf, and Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. This Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt is ſaid to be unpardonable, not that it exceedeth or ſurmounteth the greatneſs of the Merit of Chriſt, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he that commits it is puniſhed with a final Blindeneſs, and without Repentance there is granted no Remiſſion of Sins; neither is it unpardonable becauſe it is greater then Gods Mercy, or as <hi>Cain</hi> thought, <hi>Greater then can be pardoned,</hi> Gen. 4.13. but becauſe the heart of him who committeth it is uncapable of Mercy: As if a ventleſs Veſſel be caſt into the Sea, it cannot take in one drop of water, not becauſe there is not water enough in the Sea to fill it, but becauſe it had never a vent to receive water.</p>

Thus may we ſay of <hi>Davids</hi> Adultery and Murther, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. though the leaſt ſin in its own nature is mortal, and merits Damnation: No ſin is venial ſo long as we follow it, and no ſin is mortal when once we forſake it,

This <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth to be the cauſe why his ſin was venial unto him, and why he obtained mercy and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13. yet ſins of all ſorts ſpringing from this Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Error and Ignorance, in themſelves conſidered, are damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</item>

                        <item>4. Neglect of good Duties unto our Brethren, as of Exhortation, Admonition, Inſtruction, Edification by word or example, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof or Rebuke.</item>
                        <item>5. Evil Example in the practice of any Sin whatſoever: This is like Wildefire.</item>

                        <item>1. Particular, when a man wittingly and willingly ſinneth againſt ſome particular Commandment, as <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51: The Jews were ſtiff-necked, and always reſiſted the Holy Ghoſt; that is, the Miniſtery of the Prophets in ſome things, not in all.</item>

                        <item>2. The Efficient Cauſe of it, which is a purpoſed and obſtinate Malice againſt God, and againſt his Chriſt.</item>
                        <item>3. The Object, namely, God himſelf, and the Mediator Chriſt Jeſus; for the Malice of this Sin is directed againſt the very Majeſty of God himſelf, and againſt Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29.</item>
                        <item>4. The Subject in which it is. This Sin is found in none at all, but ſuch as have been enlightned by the Holy Ghoſt, and have taſted of the Gift of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.5, 6.</item>

                  <p>That we may ever ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor the very thought of ſin, conſider feriouſly theſe two moſt cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fruits and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects thereof; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. It converted happy and bleſſed Angels into curſed and damned Spirits, for the Devils by Creation were good Angels, as Powerful, Wiſe, Quick, Speedy, Inviſible, Immortal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as any other Angels; equal in every reſpect, but inferior in no reſpect to the very beſt Angels. Now when they fell, they loſt not their natural Subſtance and eſſential Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties thereof, no more then man loſt his when he fell: For as man remained to be not onely Fleſh and Blood, but alſo a Living, yea, and a reaſonable Creature after his Fall: So the Devil remained to be a Spirit, Inviſible, Immortal, Quick, Speedy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as before, onely the Quality of his Nature and Properties is altered from Good to Evil. Now the things which eſpecially make them ſeem ſo terrible, are, Their Power, Malice, Subtilty, Sedulity, and Speed; for where Malice is ſtrengthned by Might, Might whetted on by Malice, both Malice and Power guided by Craft, Craft and all ſtirred up by Diligence, Sedulity, and Speed, the Enemy is prevalent: Be wiſe therefore, Watch and Pray, ſtand faſt in the Faith. Yet know, that the Devil is not able to do whatſoever he will; for this is proper onely to God, whoſe Power is Infinite, but the Devils Power is a created Power, and therefore limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within bounds of a Creature; yea, he is not able to do any
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:97622:188"/>thing ſimply above, or directly againſt that courſe which the Lord hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto his Creatures, which is commonly called, The courſe of Nature; for God hath tied all his Creatures thereunto, and hath reſerved onely for himſelf, who is the ſole Lord of Nature, power to alter it as pleaſeth him. But the extraordinary power of the Devil conſiſteth in this, That he can do any thing that is within the compaſs of Nature, and may be effected by Natural means, as the violent moving of the Air, cauſing of Tempeſts and Storms, Thunder and Lightning, troubling the Seas, the cauſing of Earth-quakes, throwing down Buildings, rooting up Trees, entring into Bodies, both of Men and Beaſts, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into Fire and Water, grievouſly vexing and tormenting them, inflict ſore Diſeaſes on them, poſſeſs them, make them Lunatick, Deaf, Dumb, Blinde, ſtir up Wrath, Pride, Covetouſneſs, Luſt, and the like Paſſions in men: He knows the diſpoſitions of men, and accordingly layes baits for them; he can darken their Underſtandings, and cauſe much Anguiſh in their Soul and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; he can inrage Man againſt Man, Kingdom againſt Kingdom, Subjects againſt Princes, Princes againſt Subjects, and ſo cauſe whatſoever miſchief can be cauſed, which the whole World may witneſs by too woful Experience. As touching the Nature of Devils, they are Spiritual Subſtances, they were created Spirits, and Spirits they ſtill remain to be, their Fall hath not altered their Subſtance, but the Quality of it, for elſe could not that Nature and Subſtance which tranſgreſſed, be puniſhed. Groſly therefore do they erre, who Think and Teach, That they be nothing elſe, but bad Qualities and evil Affections, which ariſe from our Fleſh. If becauſe they are Spiritual things they ſhould be no Subſtances, but onely Qualities, then neither ſhould the Souls of Men nor good Angels be Subſtances; for theſe are termed Spirits, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. Spiritual things may be as truly and properly Subſtances, as Bodily things: And as for the Devils, the Actions which they perform, the Places where they are, the Power wherewith they are endued, and the Pains and Torments which they ſuffer, evidently ſhew that they are plainly and truly Subſtances. And we may know, that in Hell there are both degrees of Torments, and degrees of Devils; for there is one Head of wicked Spirits, called <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> or The Devil, who hath innumerable wicked Angels miniſtring unto him, as may be gathered, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.41. where Hell is ſaid to be prepared for the Devil and his Angels: And it is not unlike, that they are more in number, then all the men upon the Earth; for where can any man be in this Life, but ſome wicked Spirit will be ready to tempt him to ſin? And though the Evil Motions ariſe from our own Corruption, yet the Devils help is never wanting to bring them into Action, which confutes the folly of our common people, who never dread the Devil, but when he appears unto them in ſome horrid ſhape; they think he is never neer them, but when they ſee him; but it is far otherwiſe, and there is more Reaſon to fear his Temptations, then his Appearance; for this is not ſo terrible to the Sight, as his Temptations are hurtful to the Soul: And this fearful Fiend, this curſed Spirit, this damned Devil had not been at all, had it not been for Sin.</item>

                  <p>A <hi>Good Work,</hi> is a Duty commanded of God, performed by a Regenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and done in Faith, aiming therein at the Glory of God, and the good of Men; I mean not the Popiſh meritorious Works, but ſuch as are the Fruits and Effects of a Living and Effectual Faith; ſo called, not that they are without imperfection, even the beſt of them, but becauſe from the true Believer, God is pleaſed to accept of them as good; yet he accepts them not, ſeem they never ſo good, no farther then he findes Faith in them; and yet accepts he the gift, be it never ſo ſmall, for the givers ſake, if he believe in him. Thus Works of Juſtice, Temperance, and the like, cannot be called Godlineſs or good Works, except they riſe from Faith, becauſe indeed it is not done to God; for further then a man doth a thing out of Faith, he doth it not to God: For to do a thing out of Faith is nothing elſe, but when out of perſwaſion of Gods love to me, I do this thing meerly for his ſake whom I have choſen, to whom I give my ſelf; one that I know loves me, and therefore though there were no reward for it, I would ſerve him: This is a Work of Faith, inſomuch as that Almſdeeds, Martyrdom, or the like, may not be called Good Works, if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed not from Faith. Yet ſhall the common actions of our Calling be reckoned Good Works, if they come from Faith and Love, if they be done as to the Lord,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:97622:191"/>and ſo he will accept them; and for this cauſe the good purpoſes in many are naught, becauſe they have not Faith for their ground. Good Works are the Fruit of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, they go not before Juſtification, but they follow after a man is juſtified: For firſt by Grace we are juſtified, and being juſtified, we perform Good Works; for man cannot do any work that is good and godly, being not yet Regenerate, but when he is prevented by the Grace of Chriſt, and the Inſpiration of his Spirit, by the Holy Ghoſt, then he may do good Works; and the beſt Works before the Grace of Chriſt, and the Inſpiration of his Spirit, are not pleaſing to God, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as they ſpring not of Faith; yea before Juſtification they have the Nature of Sin. Now here we muſt know, that good Works are in a kinde neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet not as Cauſes thereof, either efficient or helping any way, but onely as an evidence whereby we may know that we are in the way to Salvation: For Faith is neceſſary, and good Works are the Tokens and Fruits of Faith, and ſo are neceſſary alſo.</p>

To make the work meritorious, there muſt be a proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Work, and Life Eternal, the reward of the Work; but man cannot do a work proportionable to Eternal glory, for he takes all of God, and can give nothing to him; beſides, man is a Creature, and therefore whatſoever he hath or can do, is no more then what he oweth to God.</item>

                  <p>A more large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Proofs of this Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That Good Works cannot Merit; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. Our beſt works are imperfect, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. Works indeed good neither are nor can be performed of us, without our renewing by the Holy Ghoſt; neither proceed they from our ſelves, but are the Gifts and Effects of God in us, and we his Inſtruments unto whom he communicateth his Bleſſings; in us as in the Subject, by us as the Inſtruments: The purity of which actions are ſuppoſed to be no farther pure, then the purity and light of their Mindes may be ſuppoſed to be. Thus on the light of Nature may follow actions morally good; upon Spiritual light follow actions alſo Spiritually good, or Good Works; upon imperfect illight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, imperfect Obedience; on perfect illightning, perfect Obedience alſo followeth, which though in this life is not, but deferred till the life to come, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. yet are the godly, in whoſe hearts the life of Faith is kindled, pure in the ſight of God, when he beholdeth them in Chriſt; though their good Works cannot be perfect ſo long as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who work joyntly with the Spirit, are not perfect: yet ſhall not their Imperfections, nor the Imperfections of their works, be imputed to them, but the Perfection of their Saviors Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</item>
                        <item>2. The Good Works, whatſoever we are able to do, are all due, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.10. therefore no man ought to be beguiled to ſlacken his ſtrictneſs in avoiding any ſin, or his Conſcionableneſs in performing any bounden Duty, by a Suggeſtion of Satans, that he may be over-juſt, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.18. For in true Righteouſneſs a man cannot be over-juſt; but for a man to make a Righteouſneſs unto himſelf, which is not grounded on Gods VVord, and therein to be ſtrict, is to be over-juſt, and to perform more then is due unto God. To count ſuch things to be ſin, which by Gods Law are not made ſin, is to be over-juſt, and to be cenſorious without juſt ground, is to be over-juſt: but we regulating our ſelves by Gods VVord, when we ſhall have done all thoſe things which are commanded us, muſt ſay, <hi>We are unprofitable ſervants, and have done but that which is our duty to do,</hi> and therefore far from meriting.</item>
                        <item>3. Our VVorks are impure and vicious, however they ſeem moſt good, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 64.6. for if any works proceed good from us, they are not ours, but Gods good works in us, as the Subject, and by us as the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; neither are they good works which are imagined by us, as ſeeming by us to be right and good, or which are commanded by men, but ſuch onely which are done by a true Faith, according to Gods Law, and are referred onely to his Glory; yet, though the Righteouſneſs of the holieſt Saints, conſidered in it ſelf, and compared with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Rule of the Law, be exceeding defective; or oppoſed to the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of Chriſt, be as nothing: yet as it is a work of Gods holy Spirit in us, proceeding from an heart purified by Faith, all the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections thereof being covered with the perfect Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, it is acceptable to God, and ſuch a thing as we may receive much comfort by; but not glory in, or think to merit ought thereby.</item>
                        <item>4. If we do any good VVorks, they are not ours, but are belonging to God onely, <hi>who worketh in us both to will and to do of his own good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> Phil. 2.13. and therefore good VVorks in us can merit nought,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:97622:193"/>unleſs it be a Curſe for thoſe imperfections and defilements which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably in them, by reaſon of that ſtaining quality which remains in our depraved Nature.</item>
                        <item>5. No Creature whatever he do can merit of God by order of Juſtice, even becauſe the Creature can never do ſufficient to merit the work and benefit of his Creation at the hands of his Creator.</item>
                        <item>6. There can be no proportion betwixt our Works and the excellency of Gods Gifts.</item>
                        <item>7. If our Works ſhould merit, Chriſt ſhould not be a perfect Savior, nor Heaven purchaſed for us by his Blood onely; which now to affirm, is, To Crucifie him worſe then the Jews did.</item>

                  <p>
                     <hi>REpentance</hi> is a conſtant turning from all ſin unto God, or an inward ſorrowing and continually mourning for ſin, joyned with Faith and Humiliation, and both inward and outward amendment. It is an averſion or turning from all a mans ſins, and a reverſion or turning again unto God with all our Hearts: Or, Repentance is an unfained ſorrow for, and hatred of ſin, with an earneſt Love of Righteouſneſs, by the which we are continually ſtirred up to abhor our Vices, and are moved to do good Works, not for fear of puniſhment or hope of reward, but for that love we bear towards God; that with a joyful heart we are moved to his Obedience, and with grief go aſtray from his Commandments. A Godly ſorrow, whereby a man is grieved for his ſins, becauſe they are ſins, is the beginning of Repentance, and indeed for ſubſtance it is Repentance it ſelf. So a deſire to repent and believe in a touched Heart and Conſcience, is Faith and Repentance it ſelf, though not in Nature, yet in Gods acceptation; for in them that have Grace, God accepteth the will for the deed. Alſo he that is grieved truly and unfainedly from his heart for one ſin, ſhall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably be grieved for all the ſins that he knoweth to be in himſelf; for in the moſt Regenerate there remain ſome unknown ſins, of which he cannot have a particular Repentance, and yet they are not imputed when there is Repentance for known ſins. Thus <hi>David</hi> repented of his Murther and Adultery, and yet afterward (erring in judgement by reaſon of the corruption of the times) lived to his death in the ſin of Poligamy, without any particular Repentance that we hear of; ſo the Patriarchs, but God in mercy received a general Repentance for the ſame, provided we endeavor to finde out particular ſins.</p>
                  <p>Now though Godly ſorrow be the beginning of Repentance, yet Repentance it ſelf doth chiefly conſiſt in a change of Life upon this Sorrow, and this ſtandeth in a conſtant purpoſe of the Minde, and reſolution of the Heart, not to ſin, but in every thing to do the Will of God. In this purpoſe ſtands the very nature of Repentance, nor muſt it be ſeveral from Humiliation and Faith. We cannot ſo much as think of our ſins aright without grief of heart, neither ought we to be grieved for this grief, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.8. This Sorrow pleaſeth God greatly, and maketh glad the Angels in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.10. And bringeth the Mourners unto infinite joy and peace of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Some there are that repent of their Repentance, are ſorry they have ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed for thoſe ſins they yet delight in. This is the height of Impiety, and that which filled the hardneſs of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart to the full; nor were the Iſraelites them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves free there-from, when their murmuring appetites luſted after the Fleſh-pots of <hi>Egypt:</hi> But he that indeed repents, mourns that he hath not mourned, repents that he hath not repented, humbles himſelf becauſe he hath not been humbled. This is that which a man muſt do before he can truly repent of any particular ſin whatſoever. And ſuch think it, nay they know it to be impoſſible for them to repent enough: Such are our Offences againſt the Eternal and Infinite Majeſty of God, as no man is ſo humbled for them, as that he can ſay, He need be humbled no more for them. So that this is an undeniable Truth, a general Rule without exception, That whoſoever is come to this paſs to think he hath repented enough, he is not in the account of Gods Word a true Convert or Penitent: Could our life in length equal <hi>Methuſelahs,</hi> and our Repentance in an undiſcontinued practice thereof equal our Life; all this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the Infinity of the Majeſty offended, would come ſhort to entitle it Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lived. An unintermitted Watchfulneſs, fed and ſupported by a daily conſtant revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of faithful Prayers, is the pith of Repentance, which is likely to prove ſo much the ſounder, by how much the more free and voluntary the performance thereof is; for extorted and inforced Repentance, though it often proves ſound and good, no doubt, yet may not be always ſo; the inſtrumental cauſe thereof hapning to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the Work may not go on.</p>
                  <p>Repent therefore, for except we repent we ſhall all periſh, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.3. But if
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:97622:195"/>we judge our ſelves, we ſhall not be judged of the Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31. Not as the cuſtom is, a ſeeming ſad Confeſſion of ſin out of Formality, not Conſcience, of Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without remorſe, or of fear without change; like <hi>Judas,</hi> who confeſſed he had ſinned in betraying innocent blood. This is not to repent, nor can we be ſaid to be truly penitent, when the Judgements upon us for ſin, grieve us more then the ſins themſelves. And although whenſoever an unrighteous man truly repenteth, he ſhall be pardoned, yet he cannot truly repent whenſoever he will: Beware therefore of deferring Repentance. He that refuſes to turn when God calleth him, provokes God to refuſe to turn to him when he calls upon God, yea to give him over to the hardneſs of his heart, and to aſſign him <hi>Belſhazzers,</hi> or the rich Fools death.</p>
                  <p>There are two parts of Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. The Mortification of the Old man, that is, Of the Corruption, which by reaſon of ſin ſticketh in us.</item>

                        <item>2. A continual inward grief and ſorrow of heart for our ſins, not a worldly, but a godly ſorrow, which conſiſteth of two parts:
<list>
                              <item>1. To be diſpleaſed with our ſelves for our ſins.</item>
                              <item>2. To have a bodily moving of the heart, which often cauſeth crying and tears. The former of theſe is neceſſary; the latter is not ſimply neceſſary, though it be commendable in whomſoever it is, if it be in truth.</item>
                           </list>
                        </item>

                        <item>5. An earneſt begging of God, in the Name and Mediation of Jeſus Chriſt, pardon for all our ſins.</item>

                        <item>3. From our wretchedneſs and vileneſs by reaſon of ſin, whereby God is offended and his wrath provoked, as well as from our curſedneſs by reaſon of the puniſhment and fearful iſſue of ſin, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.18.</item>

                     <hi>OBedience,</hi> is that whereby a man being endued with Faith and Repentance, doth accordingly to the meaſure of Grace received, endeavor himſelf to yield Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to all Gods Commandments, from all the powers and parts both of his Soul and his Body. And this is called <hi>New-Obedience,</hi> becauſe it is a Renewing of that in man whereto he was perfectly enabled by Creation. This Obedience much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in obſerving the Works of Chriſt; which we muſt not underſtand of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them according to the rigor of the Law, but of a purpoſe and endeavor to keep them: For this is a Priviledge belonging to all that are in Chriſt, That God accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their wills and endeavors of Obedience for perfect Obedience it ſelf, whereupon they who have but little knowledge, if they have care to get more knowledge, &amp; make conſcience to obey that which they know, ſhall alſo have the Reward promiſed; for true Religion ſtands not in Knowledge, but in Obedience; and this is true Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, to make Conſcience of every ſin in our own perſons, to take heed of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of ſin in others, and to abſtain from the appearance of evil: and all this not for a day or a year, but from time to time in all; I ſay, all our thoughts, words and works, through the whole courſe of our life, to the end of our days. And this our Obedience muſt not onely be in doing this or that, but alſo in ſuffering the Miſeries laid upon us, to the Death; neither in keeping this or that Commandment, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially keeping them all; yea, and it muſt be ready and chearful, without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation or conſultation with fleſh and blood.</p>

               <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>Of Faſting and Holy Feaſting.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>A Religious Faſt, is an extraordinary abſtinence taken up for a Religious end; it is an abſtinence from all Commodities of this life, ſo far as come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs will allow, and neceſſity ſuffer, to make us the more humble and meet for Prayer, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.16, 17. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.16, 17, 18. It is an abſtinence from all Meats and Drinks, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.35. <hi>Jon.</hi> 3.7. The Iſraelites were commanded to put away their beſt Raiment, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33.5, 6. To abſtain from Mirth and Muſick, from Pleaſures and all Recreations, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.16. 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 7.5. <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.18. And in ſtead of theſe to give themſelves to Weeping, Mourning and Lamentation, <hi>Neh.</hi> 1.4. For this caſe they had their Sackcloth and Aſhes, to ſignifie they were no better them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. This was to continue one whole day, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.35. <hi>Judg.</hi> 20.26. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.24. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.12. Sometimes indeed they continued their Faſt longer, as occaſion ſerved, and upon extraordinary cauſes, <hi>Heſt.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 9.9. <hi>Neh.</hi> 1.1, 2. <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.1, 2. And when the Evening came they did not eat, either in quantity or quality, to recover with advantage what they had abſtained from before, but fed upon the Bread of Tears, and mingled their Drink with Weeping. So muſt we take heed that we make not our Faſts Popiſh Faſts, or rather Feaſts, and think if we abſtain from Fleſh, we may feed on other Reſtoratives; or Faſt to take the more liberty to ſin afterward, or at leaſt to ſuppoſe that we have thereby merited at Gods hands what we faſted for. Take heed of this; a rightly grounded aſſurance of Gods mercy is highly commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but a ſelf-opinionating conceit of merit for the Works ſake done, is uncreature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſumption; a flat contradiction to the very end of Faſting, which ſhould be Self-unworthineſs, Self-denial, true Humiliation.</p>
               <p>This Faſting muſt never be without Prayer; for Prayer and Faſting were joyned together, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.5. <hi>Neh.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.3. <hi>Judg.</hi> 20.26. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.37. &amp; 5.33. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.7. True indeed it is that Prayer is available without Faſting, but Faſting never without Prayer; for Faſting is not the worſhip of God, but onely a help to it; and the moſt principal end of a Religious Faſt, is Supplication or extraordinary Prayer, whereunto as ſubordinate may be added, Examination, Humiliation, and Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As touching the time of a Religious Faſt, it is now free in regard of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; indeed in the Old Teſtament they had a ſet time of Faſting, as the tenth day of the ſeventh Moneth, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.29. But in the New Teſtament there is no ſet time which bindes the Conſcience, onely men muſt Faſt as juſt occaſion is offered; and as for Civil-Politick Faſts, they are ſet for orders ſake, and not to binde the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>
               <p>Faſting was once Ceremonial, when the Lord commanded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> that every Soul once in the year ſhould humble it ſelf in Faſting before the Lord, in one of the great Aſſemblies of his people, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.29, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> &amp; 23.27, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And though the Ceremony of the day be taken away by the coming of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. yet the thing it ſelf continueth and remaineth in force. The circumſtances of Moral Duties may be changed, but the ſubſtance may not be abrogated; for where the ſame cauſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, there the thing it ſelf abideth: Therefore this holy Exerciſe is of as great and neceſſary uſe as ever it was, and remaineth in as full force and ſtrength as ever it did, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12. <hi>Luke</hi> 5.33, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.2, 3. The ſeaſons of Publike Faſts being the times of any general Affliction upon our ſelves or our Brethren, whether of Sword, Peſtilence, or Famine, or any other juſt judgement, whether threatned, feared, begun or executed. For Private Faſts, the ſame rule holds in private Afflictions,
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:97622:198"/>neither is any time unſeaſonable when the Religious Soul ſequeſters it ſelf, for this Spiritual Phyſick of private Humiliation.</p>
               <p>Holy Feaſting is a time of Solemn Thankſgiving for Benefits received, or Evils removed, wherein the Creatures of God may be more liberally uſed then at any other time: For this is a day of Rejoycing, wherein it was once ſaid to the people of God, <hi>Eat the fat, and drink the ſweet, Neh.</hi> 8.10. Wherein we muſt be very careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the fear of God within our hearts, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.12. <hi>Jobs</hi> fear was, leſt his ſons ſhould caſt this fear of God out of their hearts in their Feaſting, and ſo offend God. In every bit we eat, and every drop we drink, we muſt remember the caveat our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our gives, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.24. <hi>Take heed to your ſelves, leſt at any time your hearts be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with ſurfetting and drunkenneſs;</hi> yea in this time of Holy Feaſting there is alſo enjoyned us a certain kinde of fear of man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.1, 2. <hi>When thou ſitteſt to eat before a Ruler, put thy Knife to thy throat;</hi> that is, Bridle thine Appetite, have reſpect not to paſs the limits of Sobriety, Temperance, and Moderation. The law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of theſe Feaſts may be derived from the Primitive Church, ſo as the poor be regarded, ſuperfluity and riot avoided, and the right end intended, which is the praiſe and glory of God expreſſed in Thankfulneſs for the abundance of his Bleſſings. Thus after the Sacrifices and Offerings, <hi>Aaron</hi> and the Elders of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came to Feaſt with <hi>Jethro</hi> before God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.12. So <hi>Ezra</hi> the eight. <hi>Go your ways, eat the fat, and drink the ſweet, and ſend part to them for whom none is provided; for this is the day of the Lord.</hi> In the Primitive Church it was a Cuſtom to have a Feaſt before the Lords Supper, made by the Communicants; unto which ſome brought Honey, ſome Bread, ſome Wine, ſome Milk, and every one according to their ability contributing ſomething thereunto. Theſe were called Love Feaſts, becauſe they were herein to teſtifie their mutual Love among themſelves; as alſo to the poor, who hereby were relieved; and to the Miniſtery it ſelf, which was by theſe Feaſts partly ſuſtained. But in theſe Feaſts there were many ſpots, <hi>Jude</hi> v. 12. who were eye-ſores and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces to theſe holy Feaſts, pampering and feeding themſelves, and riotouſly waſting the Goods of the Church, in ſtead of taking care for the poor, and the Miniſtery, for whoſe this Contribution was made: It were to be wiſhed there were no ſuch ſpots in our Feaſts at this day, that neither blemiſh them by Surfetting, Drunkenneſs, or Wantonneſs, nor by excluding the poor from having an intereſt therein.</p>

With our Faſting we muſt joyn the Duties of the ſecond Table, in the works of Juſtice, Mercy, and Love to our Brethren: for without theſe our Love to God is not ſincere, and he rejects that bodily Humiliation that is ſevered from them, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

They binde men in Conſcience to many ſet days of Faſting, and make the omiſſion thereof a deadly Sin, wherein they take away our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Liberty; for there was no want of care in our Savior Chriſt to appoint all good means for the mortifying of the fleſh, and yet he preſcribed no ſet Faſts in the New-Teſtament.</item>

               <head>CHAP. VIII. <hi>Of Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ECcleſiaſtical Diſcipline is that other Key of the Kingdom of Heaven, which is joyned with that of the Preaching of the Goſpel; and doth open or ſhut, when according to the Commandment of Chriſt, they who in Name are Chriſtians, but in their Doctrine or Life, ſhew themſelves aliens from Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After they, having ſometime been admoniſhed, will not depart from their Errors and Wickedneſs, are made known unto the Church, or to them that are appointed for that matter, and purpoſe of the Church; and if neither then they obey the Admonition, are of the ſame men by interdiction from the Sacraments ſhut out from the Congregation of the Church, and by God himſelf out of the Kingdom of Heaven: And again, if they profeſs, and indeed declare amendment of life, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as Members of Chriſt and his Church, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.14, 15.</p>
               <p>This Eccleſiaſtical Diſcipline is to be miniſtred by the Paſtors of the Church, whereunto are adjoyned certain Elders, for this end as Neceſſities ſhall require, choſen of the Church. For Excommunication is an Action of the Church, perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Name of Chriſt, whereby a grievous Tranſgreſſor, or an open, ungodly and obſtinate Sinner, is baniſhed from the Fellowſhip of the Faithful, by the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Elders, by the conſent of the Church, by the Authority of Chriſt, and by the Holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>They who are to be Excommunicated, are chiefly ſuch as deny ſome Article of the Faith, or ſhew that they will not repent, nor ſubmit themſelves to the Will of God, according to his Commandments, neither make any ſcruple of perſiſting ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornly in manifeſt Wickedneſs. The chief and principal part in Excommunication, is Denunciation, whereby is denounced, That he that denyeth Faith and Repentance, is no Member of the Church, as long as he continueth ſuch. And this Denunciation whereby one is Excommunicated, is not in the Power of the Miniſter of the Church,
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:97622:201"/>but in the Power of the Church, and is done in the name of the Church, becauſe this Commandment was given by Chriſt unto the Church; and not for the deſtruction of the Sinner which is to be Excommunicated, but for his Edification or Salvation, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5.</p>
               <p>Some draw the Original of this Church Cenſure even from <hi>Adam,</hi> whom the Lord caſt out of <hi>Eden,</hi> and by an Angel kept him from re-entring, and ſuffered him not to touch or taſte of that Tree, which was a Sacrament of Life unto him. So ſome obſerve touching <hi>Cain,</hi> whom the Lord caſt out and baniſhed from his face; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the Face of God may be called The place of his ſolemn Worſhip, where he more ſpecially appears. In the time of the Law were many Ceremonies to this purpoſe; the unclean were kept from coming to the Tabernacle, from entring into the Temple, from the partaking of the Sacrifices, and from eating the Paſſover, <hi>Num.</hi> 19.13, 20. &amp; 9.13. And <hi>Abraham</hi> is commanded to caſt out the Bond-woman and her ſon out of his Family, which was the Church, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.10, 11. So in the New Teſtament, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19. &amp; 18.18. The uſe of the Keys to open and ſhut, and the words of binding and looſing come directly to this purpoſe. This was executed on <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19, 20. From all which it is very clear, That Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is a ſentence of the Church, whereby a Member thereof convicted of ſome grievous Crime, and by no means brought to Repentance, is driven out of the Church, and cut off from the Communion and Fellowſhip of the Faithful, that thereby he may be driven to Repentance.</p>
               <p>The Church is the City of God, Excommunication is the Sword: That the School of Chriſt, this is the Rod: That the Temple of God, this is as it were the Whip to ſcourge out ſuch as abuſe it and themſelves: That the Body of Chriſt, this is as a Medicine to cure the ſick Members thereof: That the Vine and Sheepfold, this ſerveth to keep the Foxes and Wolves from it. The Mark whereat Excommunication aimeth, and the end whereto it tendeth, is, That the Sinners being aſhamed, may be brought to Repentance, and that ſuch as live in the Church might not be corrupted; for the cauſe of the Inſtitution of Excommunication, is not ſo much the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sin, as the Salvation of a Sinner, the edifying of the Church, and the glory of God: For the Church, according to the Doctrine of Chriſt, ſmiteth none with the Spiritual Sword, but ſuch as are impenitent; and doth not this unto death, but unto life; and therefore receiveth them that repent.</p>
               <p>The Cenſure of Excommunication muſt be uſed as an Ordinance of God, not as an Invention of Man, not onely knowing the nature and uſe of it, but practiſing it to the glory of God, and to the good of others: Not like the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that playes faſt and looſe with the ſouls of men for gain, nor like their Apes of Modern Times, little regarding whether the Excommunicate repented or not, but more adviſing them to pay their Fees and diſcharge the Court, then to repent of their Offences. The perſons that are liable to this Cenſure of the Church, are onely ſuch as have confeſſed Chriſt, and called upon God the Father together with us, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they have denied him in their deeds; and being exhorted, will not hear; being admoniſhed, will not obey; being reproved, will not repent. As for them that are without, the Lord will judge them, the Church hath nothing to do with them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12, 13. For thoſe that were never of the Church, cannot be caſt out of it, being never of the number of the Faithful: And here alſo know, That one perſon may not be Excommunicated for another, but onely the party offending.</p>
               <p>Now if any man be truly ingrafted into Chriſt, indued with Faith in Chriſt and Repentance from dead works, being a Member of his Body, in Deed and in Truth, Excommunication ſhall hurt him nothing at all in regard of that Spiritual Union or Communion, foraſmuch as the Sentence ſo given is in that particular void and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate. And though a man juſtly deſerveth to be Excommunicated through his ſin, and to be ſeparated from the Communion of Saints, yet Excommunication is not the firſt and chief cauſe thereof, but his own ſin and the continuance in it; ſeeing it doth not ſever him from God, but declareth him to be ſevered through his impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency;
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:97622:202"/>as the Prieſts under the Law, putting out the Leprous, did not defile them with the Leproſie, but pronounced them to be defiled; or like the ſentence of the Law, which is but declared onely by the Judge upon the Malefactor: So it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency, obſtinacy, and perſeverancy in ſin, that ſeparates a ſinner from the Church, Excommunication is onely the Declarative ſentence thereof.</p>
               <p>Eccleſiaſtical Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline is the Order in the Church inſtituted by God, eſpecially for theſe two ends; <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <list>

                     <item>2. That the Converſation of every one may be looked into, that ſuch as have given offences may be amended, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the degrees preſcribed by Chriſt.</item>

               <p>The order which the Church doth uſe in the exerciſe of her power, may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in theſe three Verſes of the eighteenth Chapter of <hi>Matthew; viz.</hi>

                     <item>2. If he hearken not unto thee, let him be again privately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed by thee, taking one or two others with thee, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.16.</item>
                     <item>3. If he will not vouchſafe to hear them, tell it unto the Church; if he refuſe to hear the Church alſo, let him be unto thee as a Heathen man and a Publican, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17.</item>

               <p>In Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication there are three Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be conſidered; <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. Of God; when he doth hold any obſtinate Sinner guilty of his offence, and ſo guilty of condemnation.</item>
                     <item>2. Of the Church; after that God hath holden him guilty; for the Church is onely to pronounce, and to declare him ſo to be; not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, but with condition of Repentance.</item>
                     <item>3. Of God again; whereby he ratifies that in Heaven which the Church hath done on earth.</item>
